The _Nine-tailed Whip_ is the primary religious symbol of the Divine Masochist
faith. Its central importance is shared across the different Masochist
denominations, differing only in presentation in artistic depictions.

The Orthodox Whip is depicted as a Kalassarian nine-tailed whip, whose leather
thongs are typically stained in the four colors of the Kalassarian Imperial
court, with each thong radiating upward, away from the plaited handle. The
outermost pair is stained copper, followed by a pair stained with red, followed
by a pair stained with purple, the innermost pair stained black. Then the
singular central thong remains unstained leather.

This implement of corporal punishment was chosen as the early movement's symbol
because of the well-known story that the
[Venerable Matron](../../characters/venerable-matron.mdx) using it as her tool
to discipline the [Divine Masochist](../../characters/divine-masochist.mdx).

# The Four Dichotomies

_Main article [Four Dichotomies](./orthodox/doctrine/four-dichotomies.mdx)_

[St. Maul of Dearth](../../characters/st-maul-of-dearth.mdx) taught that the
Venerable Matron herself came to him in a dream, and taught him about the
Masochist's Four Dichotomies of the Whip. Each dichotomy is represented by one
of the pairs of the thongs in a Kalassarian nine-tailed whip and describes an
opposed pair that describes the different kinds of pain humanity must first
perceive in order to understand a matching kind of pleasure.

The Personal Dichotomy, Starvation and Satiety, is represented by the
copper-stained thongs.

The Familial Dichotomy, Longing and Love, is represented by the red thongs.

The Communal Dichotomy, Hostility and Hospitality, is represented by the purple
thongs.

The Spiritual Dichotomy, Struggle and Salvation, is represented by the black
thongs.

They all surround the unstained central thong, which represents an individual
immortal soul.
