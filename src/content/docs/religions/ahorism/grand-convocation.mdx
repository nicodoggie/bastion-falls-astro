The Grand Convocation is a meeting of the highest-ranking members of the [Ansa Ahuriyata](../../organizations/ansa-ahuriyata.mdx) of the [Ahurian Empire](../../locations/ahuria.mdx), often called during the death of the King Sorha. The meeting takes place in the capital of the empire and seat of the King, [The Island of the Gods](../../locations/island-of-the-gods.mdx) in the [Sorha Principality](../../locations/sorha.mdx).

According to Ahurian tradition, the first Grand Convocation was called for by the [Great Ahuriyata](./great-ahuriyata.mdx) himself, not only to announce that he was to delegate his authority to his twelve eldest sons and daughters, but to designate each and every Ahurian into the [Grand Ordering of the World](./grand-ordering-of-the-world.mdx), which was the first step in formalizing the [Ahorite](./index.mdx) tradition, and the governance of the Ahurian Empire as a whole.
