_Mangul-am-Arzhadad_ is the religion worshipped by the natives of an island off
the coast of [Giza](../locations/giza.mdx) called
[Arzhadi-et-Betet](../locations/arzhadi-et-betet.mdx). The religion is
considered the precursor of the Cult of the Masochist, which evolved into the
present-day [Church of the Divine Masochist](./orthodox-divine-masochist.mdx).
from it.
