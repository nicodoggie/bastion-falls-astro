Renier de Pardieu Simbal, or more commonly known as, Papa Simbal, is a self-styled shaman who operates a fortune-telling business in the outskirts of [Le Phar√© Phallique](../locations/le-phare-phallique.mdx) in the western portion of [Raibon Island](../locations/raibon-island.mdx). He was exposed as a charlatan right before he perished of mysterious circumstances on a ship bound for [Sanery](../locations/sanery.mdx).
