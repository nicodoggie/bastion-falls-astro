<Stub />
Percival Savoy was once the leader of the {{ fam(name="Savoy" )}} family's {{ org(name="Patrol Group", slug="savoy-patrol-group") }}. 

Percival was the mastermind of the [Savoy Coup d'etat](../events/savoy-coup.mdx) against
the leadership of the Savoy family and the [Bouillard](../families/bouillard.mdx) 
organization. He ordered a shipment of illicit drugs from [Mehicania](../locations/mehicania.mdx)
to be sent to [Senera](../locations/senera.mdx), then tipped off the [Port Tressemer](../locations/port-tressemer.mdx) law-enforcement authority, the [Peacekeepers](../organizations/peacekeepers-of-tressemer.mdx), that Bouillard ships were bringing in drugs. The Peacekeepers found the drugs, then
filed a case against the Bouillard Organization, and [Nicollete Bouillard](./nicolette-bouillard.mdx) herself.
