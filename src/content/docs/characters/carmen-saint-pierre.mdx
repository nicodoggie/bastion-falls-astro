# Goals

With the ouster of [Isana Walburton](./isana-walburton.mdx) on the island, and the removal of the [Reformists](../organizations/reformed-church-of-the-divine-masochist.mdx) on [Raibon Island](../locations/raibon-island.mdx) by [Hedwig Rosenkrantz](./hedwig-rosenkrantz.mdx), they had to leave operatives somehow.

Luckily, some of these Reformists were not part of the scheme to reinvent the [Hags of Hama](../organizations/hags-of-hama.mdx). *Carmen Saint-Pierre* was one of those who was given a different mission. Hers was to attempt to find influential politicians and keep tabs on their actions for future purposes. If possible, maybe even indoctrinate them. 

She had been seeding some potential marks in the [University of Sanery](../organizations/university-of-sanery.mdx) for this purpose. One of her well-developed marks was [Quinn Pratt](./quinn-pratt.mdx), who became a *legislative consultant* for Raibon vice-mayor [Degare Durant](./degare-durant.mdx).

## Green Liquid

The *Potion of Aberrant Transformation* that were being sent to the island were not a concern of hers initially, but due to elements preventing the smuggling of these potions, she had been contacted to attempt a different avenue of approach. She convinced Pratt to invite [Wanda Lavosier](./wanda-lavosier.mdx), a known corrupt government official in the [Port Rainoso Port Authority](../organizations/port-rainoso-port-authority.mdx) to move upcoming shipments into Port Authority-controlled warehouses, where the deputized [La Camaraderie](../organizations/la-camaraderie.mdx) would not be able to snoop inside without authorization.

The purpose of the Green Liquid is unknown to her.

## Deathengel

In recent days, some of her informants have found evidence of magical items entering the island from the Northern Lands, as well as a force that seems to be keeping reinforcements from getting into the island. Some allies of hers have confirmed a powerful source of [elestial magic](../species/celestial.mdx) in a nearby island, and that a number of its agents were moving against their actions.

This particular angel, the [Deathengel](./deathengel.mdx), had been a thorn on the side of the Reformists' goals in the Northern Lands for years, and his appearance in the area has become of particular interest.
