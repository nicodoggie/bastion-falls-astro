*Taurus Balimbano* is a career banker, and works at the
[Bank of Sanery](../organizations/bank-of-sanery.mdx) Financial Advisory
Department. He brought a number of high profile clients into the institution,
and is considered one of the top-performing members of the organization. He is
also an observer in Tressemer's
[Council of the Coin](../organization/council-of-the-coin.mdx), a trade
collective formed in order to rival the resources of the
[Mirian Trading Company](../organizations/mirian-trading-company.mdx).

# Early Life

Taurus was born in a shanty in the east side of
[Port Tressemer](../locations/port-tressemer.mdx) in
[Raibon Island](../locations/raibon-island.mdx) as one of many children of
*Martha Balimbano*. They were destitute, with their mother working a number of
jobs in order to keep them fed and clothed. Taurus often went with his mother to
her various jobs, including at the [Pussy Foot](../locations/pussy-foot.mdx), a
low-end brothel a few blocks away from their home. While waiting for his mother
there, he taught himself how to read and write from the magazines that are lent
to the patrons, and questions from some of the other workers at the
establishment.

He was never formally schooled until he came to impress a professor who worked
at the [Tressemer Academy](../organizations/tressemer-academy.mdx) at the age
of 12. He was given a full scholarship, free room and board in the campus
dormitories, and a sizeable stipend that he used to help his mother and his
siblings. For the first 2 years, he was required to take courses to cement a
foundation of knowledge before he was asked to select a major. He chose to
pursue Economics, optimistic that given enough knowledge, there must be a way to
ensure that the poor of Tressemer could be raised up from poverty. By the age of
18, he set out to work in Sanery as an intern to the State Minister of Finance
at the Sanerian capital [Flouimarie](../locations/flouimarie.mdx).

# Assistant to the Sanerian Finance Minister

In 1239, within a year of his internship, Balimbano was chosen to run errands
for the Assistant to the
[Sanerian Finance](../organizations/sanerian-finance-ministry.mdx) Minister at
the time, Minister *Louis Vega*. Balimbano made note of the various
appointments, special events and obligations the Minister had, separately from
the Assistant meticulously, but also secretly, while he performed his own tasks.
Being a self-professed auto-didact, though his direct superior seemed to hamper
all his efforts to progress, he learned by observation and trial and error on
how to do the job more efficiently and accurately. Before the year was over
Balimbano saw his opportunity. His superior lost minutes to an important meeting
with the Grand Merchant of the Bank of Sanery. He presented a well-organized and
annotated set of minutes, marked for what he thought would be of particular
note. His superior was promptly fired, and he was hired permanently for the
position.

During the tenure of Louis Vega which lasted until 1247 when he retired, Taurus
Balimbano served has his assistant. He had been instrumental in the research for
a number of banking reforms that Louis Vega had proposed to the
[Sanerian Assembly](../organizations/sanerian-assembly.mdx), most notably the
easing of some anti-usury statutes that were seen as a detriment to the growth
of the fledgling banking sector.

His experience in the Sanerian Finance Ministry was ultimately disillusioning
for Taurus. Though well-meaning, many of Vega's policy decisions were mostly
directed towards the merchant community, rather than addressing any of his
proposals on low interest loans for lower brackets of society. He was often
taught that the only real way to help the lower classes is to bolster the
merchant class, so they might employ more people. He was often told that the
poor did not know how to handle money responsibly, and so banks would have to
take in the additional risk, with little reward. Low interest rates for
small-value loans would translate to minimum returns, event if they were not
delinquent. The projected income would not cover the costs for non-paying
clients, and "recovery" operations.

# Bank of Sanery

Though he was offered a more permanent staffing position in the Finance
Ministry, Balimbano no longer had the same drive to work in, and the confidence
to enact change in, government. Instead, he would take on a job offer in the
Bank of Sanery in 1248. He was assigned in the Loans Department where he would
remain until the
[Seneran Invasion of Sanery](../events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/invasion-of-sanery.mdx).
