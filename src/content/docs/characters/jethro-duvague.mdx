_Jethro Duvague_ is the current Head Cook of the
[Rozenmaiden](../organizations/rozenmaiden.mdx), and was once the Grand Master
of the [La Camaraderie de la Mer](../organizations/la-camaraderie-de-la-mer.mdx)
and captain of its flagship, the [Principium](../vehicles/principium.mdx).

He was taken out of retirement by [Hedwig Rosenkrantz](./hedwig-rosenkrantz.mdx)
to become her ship's Head Cook, not only because of his culinary skills, but
also because of his knowledge and experience as a sailor.
