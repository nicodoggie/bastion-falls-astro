Born Paulus Gorius in the settlement of Dearth in the east coast of [Manascula](../locations/manascula.mdx), he was once one of the commanders of the Kalassarian Legions that maintained order in [Arzhadad](../locations/arzhadad.mdx).

During the Arzhadadi revolts following the death of the Divine Masochist, Paulus Gorius was one of the most heavy-handed enforcers against the rioting devoutees. Famously, following a vision of the [Venerable Matron](./venerable-matron.mdx) taking his [nine-tailed whip](../religions/divine-masochism/nine-tailed-whip.mdx) and using it to teach him the Masochist's ideals--specifically the [Four Dichotomies](../religions/divine-masochism/orthodox/doctrine/four-dichotomies.mdx).
