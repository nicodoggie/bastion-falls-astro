Jean-Paul de la Fouet is the captain of the [La Camarderie](../organizations/la-camaraderie.mdx) galley, the [La Carnalis](../vehicles/la-carnalis.mdx). Notorious for his deep hatred against the Seneran Navy, he is credited with the sinking of no less than 10 Seneran Frigates and 3 Warships, despite the Seneran advantage in numbers and armaments.
