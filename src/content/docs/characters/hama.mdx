*Halorin of Tochoma*, also known as the legendary *Hama*, was the leader of the [White Witches](../organizations/hags-of-hama.mdx) when they gained widespread notoriety within the territories that now comprise the [Apgarian Confederacy](../locations/apgar.mdx) due to their defense of [Mauricia](../locations/raibon-island.mdx) after the [Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire](../events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.mdx).
