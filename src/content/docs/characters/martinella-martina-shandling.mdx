_Martinella Shandling_, or more infamously _Martina_, is the proprietress of
_[The Balsawood Boad](../locations/the-narrows.mdx#the-balsawood-boat)_, and one
of the councilmembers of the Smugglers' Guild in
[the Narrows](../locations/the-narrows.mdx). Through her money-lending services,
and her partnership with
[Margaret](./marguerite-margaret-underhand.mdx), she had muscled out
all competition in the prostitution business in the Murmals district.
