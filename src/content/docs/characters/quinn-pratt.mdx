<Stub />

*Quinn Pratt* is a legislative consultant for
[Degare Durant](./degare-durant.mdx). He was born and raised in a homestead on
the outskirts of [Port Rainoso](../locations/port-rainoso.mdx).

Pratt was an alumnus of the
[University of Sanery](../organizations/university-of-sanery.mdx) College of
Law, and the first in his family to attain anything above a basic education.

Pratt was always fascinated with magic, and was always on the lookout for means
of actually being able to perform. He started with slight-of-hand and
misdirection. During his time in univesity he met with some like-minded
individuals, who shared tricks and various feats of impressive, yet mundane,
illusion.

Occasionally, one of the members of their so-called
[Society of Mundane Magic](../organizations/society-of-mundane-magic.mdx), or
the *SMM* for short, would present some folk tale, or snake oil that would
bestow magical abilities. As long as there would be no ill effects to any of
their members health, they would partake in various rituals, or consume or
otherwise manipulate various sundries that would supposedly give them magic
powers. They did not have any illusions that any of these would work, but they
did it anyway for both fun, and as a means to fulfill the requirements for such
an officially-sanctioned on-campus society.

One day though, one of the members have introduced a small subset of the group
to a spellcaster named [Carmen Saint-Pierre](./carmen-saint-pierre.mdx). Though
she was a caster, she was not a member of the
[Apgarian Military](../organizations/apgarian-military.mdx), which does mandate
a forced conscription of magic users in the country.
