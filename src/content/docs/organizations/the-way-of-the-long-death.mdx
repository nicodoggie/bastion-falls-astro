*The Way of the Long Death* is a non-secular monastic order whose creed revolves
around the members' fascination of death and ways to prevent it. The order is
said to have been founded by an [Ancient Vampire](../species/vampire.mdx). Its
monastery is located in the
[Alsatian Mountains](../locations/alsatian-mountains.mdx), a few miles away from
the town of [Salermo](../locations/salermo.mdx).
