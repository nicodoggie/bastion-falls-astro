The Peacekeepers of Tressemer are an independent, non-governmental agency tasked
with the protection and management of [Port Tressemer](./port-tressemer.mdx).
They were established due to the limited resources that can be allocated to an
armed force, such as a _gendarmerie_ in [Raibon Island](./raibon-island.mdx) due
to the [Treaty of Turain](../events/treaty-of-turain.mdx).

# History

In the years following the end of the
[Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](../events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/index.mdx), the
[Treaty of Turain](../events/treaty-of-turain.mdx) limited the amount of armed
forces on [Raibon Island](./raibon-island.mdx) as a whole. While the
[Gendarmerie](./gendarmerie-nationale.mdx) had an exception in its existence as
a defense force and a law-enforcement group, its resources were greatly limited
to prevent arming them, and using the exception as a loophole to militarize the
island.

For this reason, the Governor of [Sanery](./sanery.mdx) who administers
[Raibon Island](./raibon-island.mdx) authorized the use of a bounty system to
augment these forces. In this way, they can account for the expense differently.
While this system was useful for catching high-value criminals, this system let
low-level thugs off the hook, as not being worth the effort due to the
relatively low value of such bounties.

While the bounty system did initially relieve the gendarmerie of the burden of
additional recruitment and related equipment costs, it was clear that after a
few years, it was not a sustainable measure, as the baseline of lawlessness on
Tressemer increased.

## The Mercenary Guild

To address the increasing lawlessness, a group that included some prominent
mercenaries from the [Hunting Lodge](./hunting-lodge.mdx) petitioned the
[Town Council of Tressemer](./town-council-of-tressemer.mdx), and proposed that
bounty hunters must be a member of a guild before being allowed to take
bounties.

The proposed _Mercenary Guild_ would then enforce a tiered bounty system, where
each specific instance of lawlessness was given a rank and a specific monetary
value. In order to take higher bounties, members would be required to maintain a
quota of lower-tier bounties first. The Council accepted the proposal and
enacted an ordinance formalzing the Mercenary Guild by 1257.

## Formation

In 1260, [Anda Antorra](../characters/anda-antorra.mdx) was disturbed by the
amount of people unjustly caught by other mercenaries, making false charges to
quickly fill the low-tier quota. She used her earnings from bounties to hire
other mercenaries to catch those who were creating trumped up charges to enrich
themselves. As this kind of fraud was considered a higher-tier bounty, she still
needed to ensure that they met the minimum quota of lower-tier bounties. So, she
convinced these mercenaries to pool their resources, so they might rotate
between these lower-tier and higher-tier bounties without much disruption to
their priority.

As they increased in popularity, Antorra saw other mercenaries want to join
their "tier pool". But at these scales, she believed that she needed to
formalize the operation. The called their group _The Peacekeepers of Tressemer_
and created a framework of guidelines that members would have to follow.

## Expansion

Since the foundation of the Peacekeepers, Antorra kept on reinvesting her own
earnings into it. She purchased equipment from
[Kincade Enterprises](./kincade-enterprises.mdx) to ensure that her
mercenaries had what they needed to perform their tasks, established informant
networks to make it easier for them to gain information on their marks, and other
such expansion efforts.

Other mercenaries wanted to take advantage of all those advantages, and wanted
to join into the pool, that soon, they pretty much cornered the market on
lower-tier jobs that it became a de facto requirement for a mercenary to deal
with the Peacekeepers to do mercenary work in Tressemer.

## Official Deputization

By 1265, the Peacekeepers of Tressemer have grown to such a degree that it
already had enough infrastructure to act as a law-enforcement agency all on its
own. Its own bylaws and guidelines were in line with those of the _gendarmerie_
itself, and in some cases even exceeded its requirements. Through the
intercession of then vice mayor [Gustavia Krana](../cha racters/gustavia-krana.mdx),
Anda Antorra was able to petition the Governor to officially dissolve the
Mercenary Guild, and merge its functions into the Peacekeepers' own. A motion was
passed in the [Sanery Capitol Building](./sanery-capitol-building.mdx) that
rubberstamped the deputization.

# Present-Day Functions

Today, the Peacekeepers encompass all functions of a law-enforcement agency,
including border patrol, dock inspection and penitentiaries. They act as the
local policing force as well, removing the need of the gendarmerie to maintain a
force in Port Tressemer.

Funding comes through cuts from bounties, and from funding for non-combat
related services.
