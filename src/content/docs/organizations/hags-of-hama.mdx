_The Hags of Hama_ are a coven of magically-gifted women who resided in the
historical [Town of Hama](../locations/town-of-hama.mdx). Founded by the
legendary [Hama](../characters/Hama.mdx), the group became the defenders of
[Raibon Island](../locations/raibon-island.mdx) from foreign interlopers, and
the rest of the world of [Thera](../locations/thera.mdx) from interplanar ones.

The existence of the Hags of Hama stretches back to
pre-[Kalassarian](./kalassarian-empire.mdx) times, but rose to prominence in the
terrtories that would become the [Apgarian Confederacy](../locations/apgar.mdx)
two decades before the
[Fall of the Western Empire](../events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire.mdx).
Many of their rituals and traditions extend to even before the Kalassarians
dubbed what is presently Raibon Island as _Mauricia_. Those traditions rooted
from the Estregan [Hausi](../ethnicities/hausi.mdx) sea peoples who had
populated the islands. These aboriginal tribes venerated the _White Witches of
Tichom_. Tichom was their name for Raibon, which meant "Largest Piece Beyond the
Edge" in the old Estregan dialect they spoke. The name "White Witches" is how
the Hags referred to themselves within the group, and the term is also used to
refer to them among the locals of
[L'Illes Apgarie](../locations/l-illes-apgarie.mdx).

# History

Not much is corroborated about the history of the Hags of Hama. For example,
until recently, the eponymous Hama, founder of the Hags, was thought to be a
mythical character instead of a true historical figure. Historians, especially
those of the Divine Masochist tradition doubted the veracity of their purported
abilities. The
[Orthodox Divine Masochist](../religions/divine-masochism/orthodox/index.mdx)
position that magic disappeared from the land after the persecution and death of
the Masochist was in contradiction with the assertion that the Hags of Hama were
able to perform magical feats well into the 9th century AI. Even some of the
more prominent contemporary scholars after the
[Fall of Bastion](../events/fall-of-bastion.mdx) cast doubt on writings about
the powers of the Hags, as they were quite the outlier in the historical record.
Current scholarship purports that by the 5th century, most magical societies
seem to have lost the ability on a wide scale. It was not until the 6th day of
the 8th month of 1275 AI that the it was even confirmed that the Town of Hama
existed, when the crew of the [Rozenmaiden](./rozenmaiden.mdx) under the
leadership of
[Captain Hedwig Rosa Rosenkrantz](../characters/hedwig-rosenkrantz.mdx)
triggered its return via magical means.

Research and excavation efforts have only recently begun, and are only currently
being executed by members of the Hags themselves, and amateur crew-members of
the Rozenmaiden, with only informal invitations to members of the academia
pending talks regarding the town's legal status within the Apgarian Government.
