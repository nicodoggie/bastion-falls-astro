<Stub />

The Kingdom of Anasai was one of the Apgarian Kingdoms of the Silent Ages. Many
of its holdings have been subsumed by the
[Kingdom of Estrega](./kingdom-of-estrega.mdx) following the
[Second Anasaian-Estregan War](../events/second-anasaian-estregan-war.mdx). More
of its territories were absorbed into the
[Kingdom of Sanery](./kingdom-of-sanery.mdx) when it lost in major campaigns
during the [Battles for the Masochist](../events/battles-for-the-masochist.mdx).
After the [Third Apgarian Revolution](../events/third-apgarian-revolution.mdx),
the Kingdom of Anasai was completedly dissolved, its remaining lands were
divided between the newly established [Confederate](./apgarian-confederacy.mdx)
provinces of [Sanery](../locations/sanery.mdx) and
[Alsace](../locations/alsace.mdx)

## Dissolution

After taking the Anasai Castle and capturing the king, revolutionary general
[Bartholomew III Strandiz](../characters/bartholomew-iii-strandiz.mdx) announced
the dissolution of the Kingdom of Anasai. Strandiz had hoped that they would
allow his homeland Anasai to reestablish itself as a province, like Sanery and
Estrega were, however the revolutionary government decided against it. Anasai's
violent opposition the revolution, and its role as the counter-revolutionary
bastion have maligned it with the revolutionary army that its dissolution became
a symbol for the victory of the Third Revolution.

Instead, its holdings were maintained by the revolutionary government in the
interim. The final division of its lands were addressed in the third session of
the [First Apgarian Confederate Congress](./apgarian-congress.mdx).
