Coinciding with the Autumn Harvest Festival, *The Fall* is often mistaken to be
named after the fact that it is celebrated during the fall season. The festival,
instead, gets its name from a significant event in
[Divine Masochist](../religions/divine-masochism/index.mdx) scripture called the
*Fall Into Masochism*, ascribed to the verses describing how the
[Venerable Matron](../characters/venerable-matron.mdx) had taken in the Divine
Masochist as her servant.

That the festival is celebrated during the Fall Harvest is not coincidental,
however. Emperor Tumultus IV of the Kalassar had designated many of the pagan
festivals as days of holy observation within the Divine Masochist Church. As The
Fall was widely believed to have happened close enough to the Kalassarian
harvest festival, they were merged.
