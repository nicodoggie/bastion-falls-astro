Only 15 years since the formation of the
[Kalassarian Empire](../organizations/kalassarian-empire.mdx) from the ashes of
the [Republic of the Kalassus](../organizations/republic-of-the-kalassus.mdx),
war was declared against the
[Koradin Kurerans](../ethnicities/koradin-kurerans.mdx). The mutual show of
aggression ended about a century of close contact, communication and cooperation
between the two cultures.

# Casus Belli

The Kurerans no longer wanted to conduct trade with the empire, due to its
growing expansionist agenda. In order to justify the termination of trade
agreements, the Kurerans argued that the _Kalassarian Empire_ was no longer the
same entity as the _Republic of the Kalassus_. The argument was that, since the
party asignatory to the agreement no longer existed, the agreement was null and
void, and was no longer in force. If the Kalassarians wished to gain access to
Kureran magical devices, among other goods, they would have to apply for a new
agreement.

The Kurerans would immediately deny any application due to Kalassarian military
aggression destabilizing the [Beteran continent](../locations/betera/index.mdx).
Escalating matters, the Kurerans decided to even make deals with other polities
for defensive capabilities, most notably with
[Manascula](../locations/manascula.mdx).
