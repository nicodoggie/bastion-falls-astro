The death of the [Arzhadadi](../ethnicities/arzhadadi.mdx) man who was eventually deified as the Divine Masochist triggered an outbreak of revolt in the seemingly insignificant island of Arzhadad. The ensuing revolt was brought down as a matter of course, but the events propelled the fledgling religion into the rest of the world, eventually supplanting Kalassarian paganism almost entirely.
