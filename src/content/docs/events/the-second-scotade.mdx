<Stub />

The second in a number of attempts to retake the lands of
[Burtz](../locations/burtz.mdx) from the warlords ant the
[Reformists](../religions/divine-masochism/reformist/index.mdx) that have taken
over since the [Fall of Bastion](./fall-of-bastion.mdx).

The name derives from being *Followers of the Whip*, which was a turn of phrase
to mean one who follows in the teachings of the
[Divine Masochist](../characters/divine-masochist.mdx).
