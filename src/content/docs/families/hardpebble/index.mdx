The Hardpebble family is a prominent mercantile family in Northwestern Poasah.
They are known to have a trade network that stretches down to Southern Poasah
and Kolha Ahuria to Western Tanduaria.

They carry a variety of perishable goods from the Poasan Breadbasket in and
around their base of operations in the small village of
[Brown Carrot](../../locations/brown-carrot.mdx) to their partners all over the
continent of [Betera](../../locations/betera/index.mdx).

In recent years, they have been linked to the
[Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist](../../religions/divine-masochism/reformist/index.mdx)
and illegal trafficking of magically-capable persons.
