The Durant family originally hail from mainland
[Sanery](../../locations/sanery.mdx) and were staunch anti-Masochist. During the
[Battles for the Masochist](../../events/battles-for-the-masochist.mdx) in the
1000s that made the [de la Fouet](../de-la-fouet.mdx) family famous, the
Durants, amongst others moved to
[Raibon Island](../../locations/raibon-island.mdx) in protest. The thought was,
that they would eventually mount a counter-offensive to suppress the Masochistas
in the mainland. They ultimately failed to mount any sort of resistance, as
fielding soldiers proved difficult.

Most present-day Durants are still of the
[Apgarian Paganist](../../religions/paganism/apgarian/index.mdx) persuasion,
with notable exceptions being a branch who had married into the
[McFarland](../mcfarland/index.mdx) family, as they follow
[Northern Paganist](../../religions/paganism/northern/index.mdx) traditions.
