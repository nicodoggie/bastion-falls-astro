The _Bentayga_ clan is a close-knit family of ethnically
[Parpelissian](../../ethnicities/parpelissian.mdx) sailors who have come to
spread across the islands on the
[Sarmatian Sea](../../locations/sarmatian-sea.mdx). They are renowned to be
natural seafarers and navigators that they are highly sought after by shipping
companies, smugglers, privateers and navies around the known world.

A disproportionate number of them have moved into Raibon Island and intermarried
with some of the prominent families on the island.
