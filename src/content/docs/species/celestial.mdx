_Celestials_ are a collection of creatures that are found primarily in the
[Celestial Planes](../locations/celestial-planes.mdx), including
[Angels](./angel.mdx) and <Monster name="Pegasus" />. There are a few that
have chosen other planes, like the [Feywild](../locations/feywild.mdx), such as
<Monster name="Unicorn" />.
