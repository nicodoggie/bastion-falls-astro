# Corrida

The country of Corrida, so named because it was a corridor between the [Marmorantz](./marmoranz.mdx) mountain range to the north, and the [Mauh](./mauh.mdx) mountain range to the south.

The landscape is dotted by many basins, waterfalls, cliffsides, and evergreen woodlands. It was a great valley with a number of rivers and tributaries to the Great River [Loasnah](./loasnah.mdx) that flowed east to west down until the [Sea of Estrus](./sea-of-estrus.mdx), through the [Kingdom of Nura](./nura.mdx).

Corrida did not have a formal central government, but was ruled by many smaller polises with a shared cultural identity.
