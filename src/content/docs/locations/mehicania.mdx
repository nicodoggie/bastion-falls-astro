# Mehicania

The Kingdom of Mehicania is an independent country in the Posaran Basin with a
tumultuous history of war and conquest. Most recently in 1207, the country faced
a cultural and political revolution helmed by the
[Hermanos de la Libertad](../organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad.mdx),
literally _The Brotherhood of Liberty_, which sought to overthrow the Mehicanian
Royal Family and to join the [Apgarian Confederacy](./apgar.mdx).
