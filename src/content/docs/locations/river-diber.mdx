According to the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](../world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.mdx), the
River Diber flows from the Parnassus Mountains, across the land of Mir
(present-day [Mirian Peninsula](./mirian-peninsula.mdx)), through what would
become the city of Kalassus. The myth states that the river was formed from the
tears of joy shed by the mountain folk after their liberation from Parnassus Rex
Victorinus.
