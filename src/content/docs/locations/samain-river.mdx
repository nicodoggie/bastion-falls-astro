The main river on [Raibon Island](./raibon-island.mdx). It bisects the island almost equally in a north-south direction. It sources its water primarily from groundwater collected in a *[freshwater lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(hydrology))*, the [Dustain River](./dustain-river.mdx), as well as snow-melt from the [Montrabar Mountain Range](./montrabar-mountain-range.mdx).
