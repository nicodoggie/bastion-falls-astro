The Mirian Peninsula is a major landmass bounded by the
[Parnassus Mountains](./parnassus-mountains.mdx) to the north. The
peninsula is bisected by the
[Longissian Mountains](./longissian-mountains.mdx), which run
north-south and form the natural border between
[Southern Poasah](./southern-poasah.mdx) in the west and
[Kolha](./kolha.mdx) in the east.

Historically, this peninsula was known as the Land of Mir in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](../world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.mdx), and was
the birthplace of Kalassarian civilization.
