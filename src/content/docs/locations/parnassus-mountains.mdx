The Parnassus Mountains form the northern border of the Mirian Peninsula. While
featured prominently in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](../world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.mdx), these
mountains held genuine historical significance as the birthplace of what would
become the Kalassarian civilization.

The range's strategic position helped define early political boundaries and
trade routes in the region before the rise of the
[Kalassarian Empire](../organizations/kalassarian-empire.mdx).
