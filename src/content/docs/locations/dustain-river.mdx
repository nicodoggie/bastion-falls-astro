The only major tributary to the [Samain River](./samain-river.mdx). It's waters
ultimately derive from the glacial snowmelt upon the peaks of the
[Montrabar Mountain Range](./montrabar-mountain-range.mdx), especially
[Trabar's Peak](./trabars-peak.mdx), which then collects into aquifers and
lakes, most notably the lakes [Soiree](./lake-soiree.mdx) and
[Runir](./lake-runir.mdx). Water flows down primarily through the
[Beauchane Falls](./beauchane-falls.mdx) into the river's _headwaters_.

The town of the [Raibonian Piedmont](./piedmont-raibon.mdx) was built about 300
yards west of Beauchane Falls, along the Dustain's banks. The settlement of
[Poisson](./poisson.mdx) was built further downstream, near where the Dustain
meets the Samain.
