Brown Carrot Village is a small-sized agricultural, timber production, and
equestrian settlement in the [Acquan Region](./acqua.mdx) of
[Poasah](./poasah.mdx), in the outskirts of
[Acqua Termina](./acqua-termina.mdx).

The village itself, and the lands that surround it are the possession of the
[Caxton Baronetcy]("@/families/caxton.md) led by
[Lord Preston Caxton](../characters/lord-preston-caxton.mdx).

One of the most notable features of the village, is that it is the base of
operations of the
[Hardpebble Trading Company]("@/organizations/hardpebble-trading-company.md),
owned and operated by the eponymous
[Hardpebble](../families/hardpebble.mdx)Â family.
