_Garatoniè_, also called _La Garatoniè Apgarienne_ is the partially isolated
north-western section of a group of territories called the
[Garatonian Lands](./garatonian-lands.mdx). The territory was retained as a part
[Apgarian Confederacy](./apgar.mdx) after the rest of the lands granted to the
nomadic [Garatonians](../ethnicities/garatonian.mdx) were ceded to
[Poasah](./poasah.mdx) under the terms of the
[Treaty of Turain](../events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/treaty-of-turain.mdx)
in 1255.
