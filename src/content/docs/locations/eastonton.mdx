_Eastonton_ was a township in the Northern
[Inespell March](./inespell-march.mdx) of the
[Eastern Seneran](./eastern-senera.mdx) region of [Senera](./senera.mdx). The
territory had since grown as the prestige of the
[House Eastonton](../families/house-eastonton.mdx) grew, and now basically
encompasses the northern portion of the Marches.
