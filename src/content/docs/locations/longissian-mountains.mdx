The Longissian Mountains are a major north-south mountain range that bisects the
Mirian Peninsula, forming the natural border between present-day
[Kolha](./kolha.mdx) and [Southern Poasah](./southern-poasah.mdx).

Historically, these mountains were home to
[Kureran](../ethnicities/koradin-kurerans.mdx) settlements, referenced in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](../world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth.mdx) as the
home of the "Magi Diminuti."
