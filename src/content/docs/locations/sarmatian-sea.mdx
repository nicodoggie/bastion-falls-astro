The *Sarmatian Sea* is a large body of salt water on the western coast of the [Apgarian Confederacy](./apgar.mdx), and wholly contains the island kingdom of [Senera](./senera.mdx). While ordinarily, the large majority of these waters would be under the jurisdiction of the [Apgarian Navy](../organizations/apgarian-military.mdx#navy), due to the war concessions given in the [Treaty of Turain](../events/treaty-of-turain.mdx), they are patrolled almost exclusively by the [Seneran Navy](../organizations/seneran-military.mdx#navy)
