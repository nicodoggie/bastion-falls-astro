The Mundaguk people are natives of the mysterious
[Moreaux Island](../locations/moreaux-island.mdx). Colloquially, they are called
the [*Monsters of Moreaux Island*](../misc/monsters-of-moreaux-island.mdx), as
popularized by the title of [Andre Arquette's](../characters/andre-arquette.mdx)
seminal work of the same name. The
[Mundaguk Language](../languages/mundaguk.mdx) is poorly-documented due to the
hostile nature of the island's inhabitants since the departure of the
shipwrecked survivors that include Arquette.

# Discovery

In 1269 AI, an expedition to document the various ethnic sub-groups in and
around the islands of [L'Illes Apgarie](../locations/l-illes-apgarie.mdx) was
launched, in a collaboration between researchers from the
[University of Mayonne](../organizations/university-of-mayonne.mdx) and the
[Estregan Institute](../organizations/estregan-institute.mdx). This was due to
reports of a subset of ethnically [Estregan](./estregan.mdx) people who have
thrived in even the smallest atolls in the island chain, and have endured by
providing services to pirates, smugglers and privateers hunted by
[Seneran Military](../organizations/seneran-military.mdx#navy) patrols.

A confrontation between a Seneran Frigate and a vessel bearing the
[Bouillard](../organizations/bouillard.mdx) family crest, had damaged the hull
of their ship forcing them to find a nearby island. The uncharted island was
surrounded by a mangrove forest and, to their surprise, was populated by a
number of people who spoke a language similar to the
[Estregan Language](../languages/estregan.mdx).

By general consensus by the survivors, they dedicated the island to the voyage's
deceased captain, [Marvin Moreaux](../characters/marvin-moreaux.mdx) when they
publish their reports on it. The natives called themselves the *Mundaguk*,
meaning "Men at the edge of the world". The Mundaguk practiced a form of
gerontophagic ritual cannibalism.

# Ritual Cannibalism

Contrary to popular belief, the Mundaguk people did not mindlessly prey on other
humans. Such a practice would have been a detriment to the survival of their
already small population. Instead, they perform a *ritual sacrifice* of older
individuals in the community. After a certain age, or if one is proven to be
mentally- infirm, a person undergoes a month-long ritual cleansing, by bathing
in water boiled with a variety of medicinal herbs and flowers.

Then, once the preparation of the body is complete, the island shamans prepare a
certain mushroom, called the Moreaux mushroom in Arquette's book, to dilute its
potent etfects. The brew is given to the sacrifice's family, which would
stimulate their senses and hunger. The mushroom has the unusual effect of making
human flesh, not just palatable when consumed, but makes it downright
irresistable. The sacrifice's throat is then sliced. Before the person even
succumbs to death, their relatives proceed to consume their flesh.

Often the effect wears off after the meal, as the medicinal bath contains some
of the antidote to the mushroom, but if the preparation of either the body. or
the brew was incorrect, there could be a chance of something going horribly
wrong.

# Seclusion

Perhaps due to the fact that the survivors of the shipwreck took many of the
Mundaguk people's cultural items, as well as stocks of the Moreaux mushroom,
they have shown aggression towards any who may attempt to land upon their
shores. However, there were some reports of Moreaux mushroom being sold in the
Apgarian black market. Either a group of people have secretly established an
exclusive deal with the people, or they may have been able to cultivate it
elsewhere.
