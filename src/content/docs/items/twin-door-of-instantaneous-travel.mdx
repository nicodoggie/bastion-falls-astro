The _Twin Door of Instantaneous Travel_ are an identical pair of oak wood doors,
with distinctively-grained olive wood inlaid into a two-panel design. Etruscan
runes are carved into the cornices that run along each panel.

When you touch the doorknob of one of the doors, you may choose to consume a
number of spell slots equivalent to the values in the _distance cost_ table
below. If you choose to do so, when you open the door, you instantaneously open
the paired door. Any number of creatures may travel between the paired doors for
as long as the door is open. Both doors close automatically if no creatures
travel between them after 5 seconds.

# Special Examples

## Walburton Doorway

The _Walburton Doorway_ is an example that connects the
[Turbiere de Hubar](../locations/turbiere-de-hubar.mdx) in
[Raibon Island](../locations/raibon-island.mdx) with the
[Walburton Mansion](../locations/walburton-mansion.mdx) in
[Hugo](../locations/hugo.mdx), about 1000 miles away. However, because there is
a _power source_ attached to it, the distance cost is only one 1st-level spell
slot.
