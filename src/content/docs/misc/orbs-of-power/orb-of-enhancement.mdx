Orbs of Enhancement are smooth spherical purple-black objects that emit a faint,
unnaturally black light. These so-called "enhancer orbs" augment a person's
natural ability to process magical energy.

Though all orbs of power are rare, comparatively orbs of enhancement are the
most common, as they can be found in natural deposits around the world. Most
recently, some deposits have been found underneath the mountains surrounding the
[Stairway to the Heavens](../../locations/stairway-to-the-heavens.mdx) in the Sorha
region of [Ahuria](../../locations/ahuria.mdx). These deposites are credited with the
survival of the [Dolo-Dolo](../../species/dolo-dolo.mdx) after the disappearance of
magic in Thera.

It is theorized that the orb that enveloped [Bastion](../../locations/bastion.mdx)
is a massive orb of enhancement.

# Effects

Close proximity to an orb of enhancement will decrease the amount of time it
takes to recover or charge magical abilities.
