What am I?\
In my youth, I thought I knew

I thought myself a pencil\
A yellow shaft marked with a two\
Sturdy, filled with purpose\
With my life, I freely drew

With reflection, perhaps I am one\
But now shaved, times more than a few\
Lead tip snapped then sharpened\
As I papered my gray hue

Eraser flat and worn and chewed\
Either end of me near my final due\
Am I now the image upon the sheet?\
Not the pencil, but the marks I drew?

Do I still have length? Pages to fill?\
I wish to have still even an inch or two\
That I can still draft a little bit more\
'Til I have nothing more to hew.
