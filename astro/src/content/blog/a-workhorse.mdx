I am a workhorse, plying an infinite field\
Farmed out by masters to reap a digital yield\
Toiling bit-by-bit, day-by-day\
For gains in which, I'll have no sway\
Until the rust wears out my shoe\
And then they render my bones for glue\
A limp workhorse then, less than manure\
Whose care those masters would not endure\
Unless I can continue to provide\
I will not be worth my hide\
Nothing to be left, not even pride\
A workhorse.\
Ragged and hoarse\
Soon dead and forgotten as a matter of course
