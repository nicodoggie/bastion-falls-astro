<Stub />

Percival Savoy was once the leader of the [Savoy](/families/savoy/)
family's [Patrol Group](/organizations/savoy-patrol-group/).

Percival was the mastermind of the [Savoy Coup d'etat](/events/savoy-coup/)
against the leadership of the Savoy family and the
[Bouillard](/families/bouillard/) organization. He ordered a shipment of
illicit drugs from [Mehicania](/locations/mehicania/) to be sent to
[Senera](/locations/senera/), then tipped off the
[Port Tressemer](/locations/port-tressemer/) law-enforcement authority, the
[Peacekeepers](/organizations/peacekeepers-of-tressemer/), that Bouillard
ships were bringing in drugs. The Peacekeepers found the drugs, then filed a
case against the Bouillard Organization, and
[Nicollete Bouillard](/characters/nicolette-bouillard/) herself.
