<Incomplete />

Born Paulina Guildenstern, was one of the most famous Apgarian theater
performers of all time. She was one of the proponents of the
[Naturalist Movement](/misc/naturalist-movement/) of Theatre in Apgar, and
a member fo the famous
[Guildenstern Travelling Troupe](/organizations/guildenstern-travelling-troupe/).
However, due to a number of controversies, most notably the
[Garatonian Aubergine Landgrab](/events/garatonian-aubergine-landgrab/),
her membership was revoked.

She continued to remain popular despite the issues, as the popularity of the
realistic depictions of the world that the naturalist movement portrayed in
their productions. She moved to [Sanery](/locations/sanery/) in part to
avoid the Guildensterns, and in part to be closer to friend and collaborator
[Helene Nice](/characters/helene-nice/).

# Leader of the Free Theater

During a tour of [Mayonne](/locations/mayonne/), she met
[Andrei Delarde](/characters/andrei-delarde/). who was drawn to her natural charisma.
He was entranced by her capability of "changing faces" with every new
performance, despite lacking the ability to cast magic. They eventually
collaborated on a number of productions, including some that they had used to
extract a large amount of capital from a number of investors.

Eventually, some of her controversies had caught up with her while she was in
Mayonne as one business magnate had threatened to expose her, if she did not cut
him into their profits. She agreed to their terms, but had made a plan with
Delarde to bring them into the play and kill him on-stage, pretending that it
was all an act. Then Delarde would use magic to stage an accident after the
fact. From then on, they performed a number of contract killings on stage.

They would expand their operations after they attract
[Alfred Panet](/characters/alfred-panet/) due to the novel ways they kill.
