<Stub />

*Narmaya* was a young Anasaian girl who turned into a
[Vampire](/species/vampire/) due to unknown circumstances. Since her
transformation, she has lived for approximately 400 years. After being captured
by a priest of the [Divine Masochist](/religions/divine-masochism/),
she was imprisoned in a casket and set adrift into the sea. She was later found
in a ship's graveyard in the Northern Sea.

### Background

Northern Sea.
