*Seraphine Durant née Gognon* was the daughter of
[Estregan](/locations/estrega/) politician,
[Emile Gognon](/characters/emile-gognon/), and wife to
[Port Rainoso](/locations/port-rainoso/) vice-mayor
[Degare Durant](/characters/degare-durant/). She is not very well-known in the public
eye, as she tends to shy away from the spotlight that is usually shone upon her
family and their accomplishments.

She is quite known to be the quiet type, oft letting her husband do most of the
talking, while she brings food or beverages to their guests, despite there being
servants around to do the same.

Her marriage to Durant caused quite a stir. Aside from the fact that Durant's
ex-wife [Elodië Durant née Bentayga](/characters/elodie-bentayga/) died a less than a
month prior, but also due to the fact the the
[Durant family](/families/durant/) was once staunchly anti-Masochist,
and the [Gognons](/families/gognon/) were one of the most devout in
Estrega. However, Degare's branch who inter-married with the
[Iutlandish](/locations/iutland/)
[McFarlands](/families/mcfarland/) were not as aggressive in their
stance as those of the main one from [Sanery](/locations/sanery/).

# Early Age

She always had a voice inside her head from a young age, telling her what to do
and what might be good or bad. This had caused her to be such a reserved
individual. The voice always mentioned that she was no prophet, but instead a
guardian. She would be destined to protect a person from not just death, but
also from pain and hurt, and she would know when that would happen.

# Charity

She and the wives and husbands of prominent Rainoso politicians run a monthly
charitable event on the second friday of each month. The specific charity
differs from month-to-month, rotating from a list of pre-approved charities. She
favors those charities, whose aims are to bring some semblance of joy to others,
aside from simply helping with the immediate needs.

# Celestial Origin

Angels usually cannot
