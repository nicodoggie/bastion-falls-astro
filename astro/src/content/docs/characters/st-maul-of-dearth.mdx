*St. Maul of Dearth* One of the religious leaders of the early
[Divine Masochist](/religions/divine-masochism/) Church. Born Paulus
Gorius in the settlement of Dearth in the east coast of
[Manascula](/locations/manascula/), he was once one of the commanders of
the Kalassarian Legions that maintained order in
[Arzhadad](/locations/arzhadad/).

During the Arzhadadi revolts following the death of the Divine Masochist, Paulus
Gorius was one of the most heavy-handed enforcers against the rioting devoutees.
Famously, following a vision of the [Venerable Matron](/characters/venerable-matron/)
taking his
[nine-tailed whip](/religions/divine-masochism/nine-tailed-whip/) and using
it to teach him the Masochist's ideals--specifically the
[Four Dichotomies](/religions/divine-masochism/orthodox/doctrine/four-dichotomies/).
After the vision, he declared himself reborn as Maul of Dearth.
