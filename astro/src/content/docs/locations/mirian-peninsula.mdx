The Mirian Peninsula is a major landmass bounded by the
[Parnassus Mountains](/locations/parnassus-mountains) to the north. The peninsula is
bisected by the [Longissian Mountains](/locations/longissian-mountains), which run
north-south and form the natural border between
[Southern Poasah](/locations/southern-poasah) in the west and [Kolha](/locations/kolha) in
the east.

Historically, this peninsula was known as the Land of Mir in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](/world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth/), and
was the birthplace of Kalassarian civilization.
