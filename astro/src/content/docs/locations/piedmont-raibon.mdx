A settlement at the foot of Montrabar on the banks of the
[Dustain River](/locations/dustain-river), which is a tributary to the
[Samain River](/locations/samain-river). It is one of the many towns and cities in
the [Apgarian Confederacy](/locations/apgar) named Piedmont, which literally
translates to *foot of the mountain*. It has become a hub of trade a few years
after its founding, after a passage was found that connected
[Montrabar Pass](/locations/montrabar-pass) to the source of the Durain River.

The settlement is accessible by small to medium-sized flat-bottomed boats via
the Dustain River, with most traffic coming from
[Port Tressemer](/locations/port-tressemer) to facilitate trade from the mountains,
and from the eastern side of [Raibon Island](/locations/raibon-island). It is also
accessible via a passage that leads to the more established Montrabar Pass,
which also served to more efficiently connect it to the Piedmont and a number of
farmland.

Some prospectors have recently began settling in the Piedmont in hopes of
finding rice veins of ore in and around the Montrabar mountain range, especially
due to the slowly dwindling output of the iron mines at [Hamlin](/locations/hamlin).
