*Eastonton* was a township in the Northern
[Inespell Marches](/locations/inespell-marches) of the
[Eastern Seneran](/locations/eastern-senera) region of [Senera](/locations/senera). The
territory had since grown as the prestige of the
[House Eastonton](/families/house-eastonton/) grew, and now basically
encompasses the northern portion of the Marches.
