_Eastonton_ was a township in the Northern
[Inespell Marches](/locations/inespell-marches) of the
[Eastern Seneran](/locations/eastern-senera) region of
[Senera](/locations/senera). The territory had since grown as the prestige of
the [House Eastonton](/families/house-eastonton/) grew, and now basically
encompasses the northern portion of the Marches.
