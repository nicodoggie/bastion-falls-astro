Kolha occupies the eastern portion of the Mirian Peninsula, bounded by the
[Longissian Mountains](/locations/longissian-mountains) to the west. These mountains
form the natural border between Kolha and
[Southern Poasah](/locations/southern-poasah).

# History

## Rise to Power

Under [Kolha I](/characters/kolha-i/), the region became a crucial part of
the [Ahurian Empire](/locations/ahuria)'s expansion. In 466 AI, Kolha I led Ahurian
forces in the [Kolhan Conquest](/events/kolhan-conquest/), which culminated
in the razing of the city of Kalassus.

## Modern Era

As a principality of the Ahurian Empire, Kolha continues to be an integral part
of Ahuria. The Revolt of the Kolhan Ansa (1250-1254 AI), triggered by the death
of Prince Kolha XVIII, resulted in several territories seceding from Kolha to
form independent principalities separate from Ahurian control.
