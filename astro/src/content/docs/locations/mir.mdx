Mir is one of the five
[Secessionist Principalities](/organizations/secessionist-principalities/)
that broke away from [Kolha](/locations/kolha) during the
[Revolt of the Kolhan Ansa](/events/revolt-of-the-kolhan-ansa/) (1250-1254
AI). The principality takes its name from the historical
[Mirian Peninsula](/locations/mirian-peninsula).
