The only major tributary to the [Samain River](/locations/samain-river). It's waters
ultimately derive from the glacial snowmelt upon the peaks of the
[Montrabar Mountain Range](/locations/montrabar-mountain-range), especially
[Trabar's Peak](/locations/trabars-peak), which then collects into aquifers and
lakes, most notably the lakes [Soiree](/locations/lake-soiree) and
[Runir](/locations/lake-runir). Water flows down primarily through the
[Beauchane Falls](/locations/beauchane-falls) into the river's *headwaters*.

The town of the [Raibonian Piedmont](/locations/piedmont-raibon) was built about 300
yards west of Beauchane Falls, along the Dustain's banks. The settlement of
[Poisson](/locations/poisson) was built further downstream, near where the Dustain
meets the Samain.
