*L'Illes Apgarie* is an archipelago in the northwest corner of the
[Apgarian Confederacy](/locations/apgar). Administratively, the islands are part of
the [Sanery](/locations/sanery) region, but due to the provisions of the
[Treaty of Turain](/events/treaty-of-turain/), a large part of the area,
especially those in the waters surrounding [Raibon Island](/locations/raibon-island),
are a demilitarized zone.

## History

### Pre-Silent Ages

The islands were originally settled by the seafaring descendants of the
[Estregan](/ethnicities/estregan/) people, which is reflected in the
language spoken by many of its native inhabitants. The isolated community of
cannibal in [Moreaux Island](/locations/moreaux-island) in particular is referenced
as proof of this, as their language preserves words and grammar that are close
to Estregan dialects that have not been as influenced by Kalassarian as the rest
of the region.

Though the islands were nominally part of the Kalassarian Empire during its
height, they did not seem to have invested much in the region, with the
exception of present-day Raibon Island, which was documented to have been called
*Mauricia* by Kalassarian administrative documents.

The
[Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire](/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire/)
did not seem to have much impact on the islands, in fact the islands seem to
have thrived. The administration from the [Town of Hama](/locations/hama) have
shielded the inhabitants of the islands from many of the effects and the
conflicts that followed. They also encouraged trade in the region by offering
protection and shelter to many mercantile fleets that plied the region from
pirates and other threats.

### Silent Ages

The destruction of the Town of Hama in 910 AI was shrouded in mystery. One of
the major theories of its destruction is an extreme seismic event that occurred
at the time, causing the bedrock to fracture and fall into the sea. The creation
of many islets to the east of Raibon Island, called
[Hama's Tears](/locations/hamas-tears) led credence to this theory.

Its destruction, however, and the loss of prominence of the
[White Witches](/organizations/hags-of-hama/) that led it, opened the
region up to the influence of the kingdoms of the
[Silent Ages](/concepts/silent-ages/) of Apgar. The kingdoms of
Anasai, Estrega and Sanery, at some point, have all claimed the islands, with
the islands being held by Estrega after the
[First Anasaian-Estregan War](/events/first-anasaian-estregan-war/).

### Estrega Period

After the death of King Raibon II in 970 AI, the islands were renamed in his
honor, with the Turbiere d'Hama renamed to the Turbiere d'Hubar, in honor of
Raibon's elder brother, Prince Hubar, who as lost at sea.

The islands were part of the Estregan Kingdom until the
[Third Apgarian Revolution](/events/third-apgarian-revolution/), when the
Apgarian Confederacy was formed, and the islands were placed under the
administration of the province of [Sanery](/locations/sanery).

### Pre-Turain Period

The islands were difficult for the the Confederacy to administer right after its
formation due to their underdeveloped Naval infrastructure. This meant that the
Confederacy was unable to effectively enforce its authority over the islands,
instead the islands were actually operated by organized crime syndicates that
have formed during the various Apgarian revolutions.

However, as the Apgarian Navy had gained in strength and capability, the island
of Raibon, Sentimental and Rackospalma were subjugated and brought under the
control of the Confederacy in the 1240s AI, just a few years before the
[Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/) started.

### Poasan-Apgarian Conflict

Many of the clashes between the Confederacy and Senera, Poasah's biggest ally in
the regions, were fought in the waters surrounding the islands. Raibon in
particular saw many conflicts, with an attempt by Senera to colonize it.

The attempt by Senera to take Raibon aligned the interests of the criminal
organizations that thrived on the island with the Confederacy, who issued many
of these groups with Letters of Marque that legitimized their actions. These
organizations included the [Bouillard](/organizations/bouillard/), the
[Parvese](/organizations/parvese-houses-of-pleasures/) and the
[Coutillie](/organizations/coutillie/) families. These groups were actually
able to turn the tide of the western front of the conflict, as they were able to
perform resupplies in areas that were besieged by joint Seneran-Poasan forces.

The conflict ended in 1255 AI with the
[Treaty of Turain](/events/treaty-of-turain/), which officially ceded the
islands back to the Apgarian Confederacy, but under special terms during the
armistice, and the terms of the treaty to follow.

### Post-Turain Period

Due to the nature of the Treaty of Turain, the northernmost islands between
Senera and the Apgarian Confederacy were demilitarized, and provided as a buffer
between the two powers. Commercial activity in the region was allowed, and was
administered nominally by [Sanery](/locations/sanery), but in practice by a
combination of elected local officials, and the criminal organizations that
retained their power, especially because of this demilitarized status.

However, recent events in 1275 is changing the balance of power in the region,
as the reestablishment of the [Hags of Hama](/organizations/hags-of-hama/)
and the return of the Town of Hama is raising questions about the future of the
region.
