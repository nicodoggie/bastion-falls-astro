The McFarland family has roots in the northern island kingdom of
[Iutland](/world/locations/iutland/). A branch of the family had migrated
southwards, and settled in [Raibon Island](/world/locations/raibon-island/).

Some of them have intermarried with the [Savoy](/world/families/savoy/) of
[Port Rainoso](/world/locations/port-rainoso/). The branch of the family is
well-known for being competent lawyers or accountants.
