*The House of Savoy of Rainoso* are a family of soldiers, support staff and
crew, who mostly serve at the pleasure of the [Bouillard](/world/families/bouillard/)
Family. The family itself were rooted from original settlers from
[Estrega](/world/locations/estrega/) when they first moved into
[Raibon Island](/world/locations/raibon-island/).

# Pater Familius

The entire Savoy clan, including its branches answer to a *Pater Familius*, the
father of the family. Usually, but not always, the title is bestowed upon the
eldest male of the main branch of the family. This form of primogeniture was
more common before the various
[Apgarian Revolutions](/world/events/first-apgarian-revolution/), and it may be that
this was a hold-over from those ways. It is unclear, however if House Savoy was
once a [Noble House](/world/organizations/noble-houses-of-apgar/).

The Pater Familius was, and is in charge of family gatherings, resolving
inter-familial squabbles, etc. In the present day, the Pater Familius also is
the primary protector of the leader of the *Bouillard* family.

# Bouillard "Vassalage"

The House Savoy declared themselves protectors of the Bouillards after
[Parvese slavers](/world/families/parvese/) have kidnapped the scions of its main branch.
[Lemuel Savoy](/world/characters/lemuel-savoy/), who was next in line to be
*Pater Familius* was captured and tortured during the attempt to rescue his
sisters from *Parvese* hands.

[Romulus Bouillard](/world/characters/romulus-bouillard/) spearheaded a number
of ships, led by his flagship
[The Black Quill](/world/vehicles/the-black-quill/), to intercept the
*Parvese* ships holding the prospective slaves. The rescue was a success, and
the Savoys, along with many others, were returned to the island. The Parvese
denied any involvement with the matter, but it was plain to the Bouillards that
they were in charge of that operation.

As thanks, Lemuel declared that as soon as he received the position of *Pater
Familius*, he would declare themselves protectors of the Bouillard family for
eternity. The family had been serving for *five generations* as of this writing.

# Monroe Savoy's Leadership

As was tradition, the position of *Pater Familius* was conferred to the eldest
male of the family, but as Lemuel neared death, his children unanimously decided
to award the honor to his second child
[Monroe Savoy](/world/characters/monroe-savoy/) due to his marriage with
Romulus' daughter [Nathalie Bouillard](/world/characters/nathalie-bouillard/).
The idea was eldest son [Madison Savoy's](/world/characters/madison-savoy/),
who did not relish the responsibility that the position brought.

Monroe spearheaded many of the professional underpinnings of the Savoys,
bringing to order the
[Savoy training compound](/world/locations/savoy-training-compound/) in
[Port Rainoso's East Side](/world/locations/port-rainoso#east-side).

# Naim's Resentment

Not everyone was happy with the transition of power to Monroe's lineage however.
[Naim Savoy](/world/characters/naim-savoy/) in particular, resented is father
from relinquishing the position. It was reported that Naim wanted the position
to steer the family away from the role of servitude from the Bouillards that
everyone else seemed to have accepted so easily. The resentment was also shared
by his wife [Portencia](/world/characters/portencia-bentayga/), as she was
shared Bouillard blood being a [Bentayga](/world/families/bentayga/), and thought
that they'd deserved more.
