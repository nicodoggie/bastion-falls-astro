The Hardpebble family is a prominent mercantile family in Northwestern Poasah.
They are known to have a trade network that stretches down to Southern Poasah
and Kolha Ahuria to Western Tanduaria.

They carry a variety of perishable goods from the Poasan Breadbasket in and
around their base of operations in the small village of
[Brown Carrot](/world/locations/brown-carrot/) to their partners all over the
continent ofÂ [Betera](/world/locations/betera/).

In recent years, they have been linked to the
[Reformed Church of the Divine Masochist](/world/religions/divine-masochism/reformist/)
and illegal trafficking of magically-capable persons.
