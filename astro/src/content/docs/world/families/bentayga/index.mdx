The *Bentayga* clan is a close-knit family of ethnically\
[Parpelissian](/world/ethnicities/parpelissian/) sailors who have come to
spread across the islands on the
[Sarmatian Sea](/world/locations/sarmatian-sea/). They are renowned to be
natural seafarers and navigators that they are highly sought after by shipping
companies, smugglers, privateers and navies around the known world.

A disproportionate number of them have moved into Raibon Island and intermarried
with some of the prominent families on the island.
