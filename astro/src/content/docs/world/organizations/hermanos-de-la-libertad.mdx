*Hermanos de la Libertad* was a [Mehicanian](/world/locations/mehicania) revolutionary
organization that was founded in 979 AI in the context of the
[First Apgarian Revolution](/world/events/first-apgarian-revolution) and the
[Paisa Massacre](/world/events/paisa-massacre). Though the initial incarnation of the
organization was ultimately a failure, the name would be revived a number of
times in the centuries to follow. The most famous of these was formed during the
1207 AI [Mehicanian Revolt](/world/events/mehicanian-revolt).
