<Stub />

La Camaraderie de la Mer, or simply La Camaraderie, is a privateering
organization secretly funded by the Apgarian government, in part to sidestep the
restrictions put in place by the
[Treaty of Turain](/world/events/treaty-of-turain/) at the end of the
[Poasan-Apgarian Conflict](/world/events/poasan-apgarian-conflict/).

Officially, La Camaraderie is a sailor's guild that operates across
[Apgar](/world/locations/apgar/) that certifies the caliber of ship officers and
sea-worthiness of shipping vessels. While they do fulfill these functions to
their entirety, with a bureaucracy that spans the country, it is an elaborate
front for their efforts to circumvent the Seneran Navy patrols given the
authority to regulate the Sarmatian leg of the Sarmatian-Posaran sea routes.
