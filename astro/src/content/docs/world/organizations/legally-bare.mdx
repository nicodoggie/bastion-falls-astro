*Legally Bare* is an adult magazine published by the Ministry of Science
established in 1274 AI. In comparison with
[Nightshift Nurses](/organizations/nightshift-nurses), another adult magazine published
by the Ministry of Science, *Legally Bare* features younger women, often only
recently entering the Apgarian age of majority, with more variety in their
pseudonymic conceits.

## Purpose and Content

Similar to its older and more popular sister publication, the magazine's
explicit imagery serves as a vehicle for disseminating scientific and empirical
knowledge to the adult population. The goal is that the enticing models would
lure in a demographic that would otherwise not be interested in subjects
broached more mainstream scientific publications.

Unlike *Nightshift Nurses*, *Legally Bare*'s columnists do not really write
their articles. Instead, ghost writers are tasked with the writing, and the
models simply pose in situations that are tangentially related to the feature.
One exception is Mia Campbell's column, which features articles regarding her
own studies about magic.
