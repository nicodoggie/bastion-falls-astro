The Order of the Angel of Justice is a Religious Society within the fold ofÂ the
[Orthodox Church of the Divine Masochist](/religions/divine-masochism/orthodox/).
While their belief is in alignment with the dogma of the Church, they emphasize
the values that the Angel of Justice represents.

Vow of Faith

The priests of the Order of Justice are given the Vow of Faith. A vow that they
must take the Word of the Masochist and the Matron as the guideposts upon which
they base their religious lives.
