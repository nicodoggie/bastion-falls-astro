Unspoiled Hydration was formed to address the even-increasing need of potable
drinking water on [Raibon Island](/locations/raibon-island/). In its
original inception, the organization was incorporated to provide the upper class
of [Port Tressemer](/locations/port-tressemer/)an uninterrupted supply of
clean drinking water for a premium service rate.

Raibon's primary body of water, famed
[Samain River](/locations/samain-river/) was deemed undrinkable, not only
due to the inherent water pollution of shipping, and human habitation, but due
to the fact that the river itself is brackish. Inflow from the surrounding sea
is at a greater rate than the outflows from tributaries like the
[Dustain River](/locations/dustain-river/). The idea of water
desalinization was rediscovered from Kalassarian documents found in ruins on
northern Apgar, and its development and construction on Tressemer was funded by
the [Council of the Coin](/organizations/council-of-the-coin).

As of 1275, it serves almost the entirety of Tressemer's wealthy West District,
and a number of mid to upscale establishments west of the river. A number of new
desalination plants are under development to provide water to the eastern part
of Raibon as well, but due to socio-political conditions in that area, securing
both land and funding has proven difficult.
