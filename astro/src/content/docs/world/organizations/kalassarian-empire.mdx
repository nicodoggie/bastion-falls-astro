The Kalassarian Empire was a continent-spanning state that succeeded the
Republic of the Kalassus in 21 PF. At its peak, it spanned from present-day
[Senera](/locations/senera/) in the west, most of
[Tanduaria](/locations/tanduaria/) up to the
[Chokhul mountain range](/locations/chokhul-mountains/) to to north, the
western edges of present-day Sarebia in the east, and portions of northern
Ralaka to the south.

Most Beteran states were either once a part of the Kalassarian Empire, or was
heavily influenced by them, and many present-day states still claim to be *the*
successor to its millenia of history.
