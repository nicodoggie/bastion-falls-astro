Benoit was a young foundling supposedly rescued and taken in by
[Rosemunda Parvese](/world/characters/rosemunda-parvese/) from the streets of the
infamous East-side of [Port Rainoso](/world/locations/port-rainoso/). Since then,
he had been groomed to take on managerial rolss of increasing importance in
the [House of Pleasures](/world/organizations/parvese-houses-of-pleasures/). At
the young age of 16, he had become a floor manager in the Miller Street House,
on track to becoming an Assistant House Manager there. 

Rosemunda. however, had other plans for the boy. Unbeknownst to most, Benoit is
the only living male heir of the Dubreuil family--maker of one of the most
well-known brands of Cognac in the Apgar Confederacy. A huge bounty was promised
to any person who gives any information that leads to his recovery. People were
told about one of two identifying marks on his body.

Rosemunda's agents have been able to find and recover Benoit. The plan was, to
negotiate a better deal in exchange for his safe return. Her quest for eternal
youth, had led her to a different path.
[Iluvia Wunderplat](/world/characters/iluvia-wunderplat/) had described to her the
abilities of the Soul Stone, which allows the transfer of a soul into a new
body. instead, she had planned to ingratiate the boy to her, and then once the
time was ripe, she would transfer her soul to his body, and gain his
inheritance. She would then have Benoit, in her old body, poisoned. She would
set it up so that Benoit becomes sole inheritor of the Parvese estates as well.
