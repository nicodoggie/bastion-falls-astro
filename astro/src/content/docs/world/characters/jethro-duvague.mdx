*Jethro Duvague* is the current Head Cook of the
[Rozenmaiden](/world/organizations/rozenmaiden/), and was once the Grand Master
of the [La Camaraderie de la Mer](/world/organizations/la-camaraderie/)
and captain of its flagship, the [Principium](/world/vehicles/principium/).

He was taken out of retirement by [Hedwig Rosenkrantz](/world/characters/hedwig-rosenkrantz/)
to become her ship's Head Cook, not only because of his culinary skills, but
also because of his knowledge and experience as a sailor.
