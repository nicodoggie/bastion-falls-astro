*Avis Savoy* is the adopted daughter of [Otto Savoy](/world/characters/otto-savoy) and
[Beatrix Farnese](/world/characters/beatrix-farnese/), and youngest sister to
[Oliver Savoy](/world/characters/oliver-savoy) and [Oscar Savoy](/world/characters/oscar-savoy). She was
left at the doorstep of the
[Savoy Patriarchal Residence](/world/locations/savoy-patriarchal-residence) by
an unknown individual. The Savoys took her in and raised her as their own.

# Early Age

# Transformation into a Celestial

# Move to Tressemer

Notes:

She was not born a celestial, instead, some entity had placed the seed of a
celestial within her. Most celestials in the prime material planed since the
decline of magic were trapped, but few are able to survive. Those that did seem
to have found themselves human hosts.
