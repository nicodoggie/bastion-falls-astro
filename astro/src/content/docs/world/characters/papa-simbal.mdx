Renier de Pardieu Simbal, or more commonly known as, Papa Simbal, is a
self-styled shaman who operates a fortune-telling business in the outskirts of
[Le Phar√© Phallique](/locations/le-phare-phallique/) in the western portion
of [Raibon Island](/locations/raibon-island/). He was exposed as a
charlatan right before he perished of mysterious circumstances on a ship bound
for [Sanery](/locations/sanery/).
