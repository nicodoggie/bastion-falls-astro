Reginald de Villa is an elected Draft Councilor in
[Port Rainoso](/world/locations/port-rainoso/). He is a 5th generation resident
from the prominent [Estregan](/world/ethnicities/estregan/) de Villa clan of
merchants.

As of 1275, he is serving his 2nd term as Draft Councilor, and is up for
re-election in the next calendar year.

He runs on a platform of island self-sufficiency. The idea is that Rainoso, and
by extension, Raibon, should be able to feed itself in the case that some
cataclysm might happen that would disrupt trade and commerce. He is a proponent
of bringing in more investors to farm the land.

He is also a proponent of perhaps extracting peat from the
[Turbiere de Hubar](/world/locations/turbiere-de-hubar/) and export it as fuel
for Sanery's lamp-lighting industry.
