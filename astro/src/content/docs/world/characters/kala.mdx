<Stub />

Kala was a legendary ruler of pre-imperial [Kalassus](/world/organizations/republic-of-the-kalassus/)
around 460 PF, approximately forty years after the city's founding. While
historical records from this period are scarce, his reign is considered a
pivotal period that helped establish the foundations of what would later become
the Kalassarian Empire.

# Legacy

The influence of Kala's rule can be seen in how his name became intrinsically
linked with the empire itself - the term "Kalassarian" is believed to be derived
from combining "Kala" with the suffix "-ssarian" (meaning "followers of" in
ancient Kalassarian). His legacy was so powerful that Tarsius Brigandus, when
founding the empire, chose to style himself as Emperor Kala I, claiming
spiritual succession to the legendary ruler. This began a tradition of imperial
legitimacy being tied to Kala's mythical reign.
