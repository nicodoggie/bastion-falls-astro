# Goals

With the ouster of [Isana Walburton](/world/characters/isana-walburton/) on the island, and
the removal of the
[Reformists](/world/organizations/reformed-church-of-the-divine-masochist/) on
[Raibon Island](/world/locations/raibon-island/) by
[Hedwig Rosenkrantz](/world/characters/hedwig-rosenkrantz/), they had to leave operatives
somehow.

Luckily, some of these Reformists were not part of the scheme to reinvent the
[Hags of Hama](/world/organizations/hags-of-hama/). *Carmen Saint-Pierre* was one
of those who was given a different mission. Hers was to attempt to find
influential politicians and keep tabs on their actions for future purposes. If
possible, maybe even indoctrinate them.

She had been seeding some potential marks in the
[University of Sanery](/world/organizations/university-of-sanery/) for this
purpose. One of her well-developed marks was [Quinn Pratt](/world/characters/quinn-pratt/),
who became a *legislative consultant* for Raibon vice-mayor
[Degare Durant](/world/characters/degare-durant/).

## Green Liquid

The *Potion of Aberrant Transformation* that were being sent to the island were
not a concern of hers initially, but due to elements preventing the smuggling of
these potions, she had been contacted to attempt a different avenue of approach.
She convinced Pratt to invite [Wanda Lavosier](/world/characters/wanda-lavosier/), a known
corrupt government official in the
[Port Rainoso Port Authority](/world/organizations/port-rainoso-port-authority/)
to move upcoming shipments into Port Authority-controlled warehouses, where the
deputized [La Camaraderie](/world/organizations/la-camaraderie/) would not be
able to snoop inside without authorization.

The purpose of the Green Liquid is unknown to her.

## Deathengel

In recent days, some of her informants have found evidence of magical items
entering the island from the Northern Lands, as well as a force that seems to be
keeping reinforcements from getting into the island. Some allies of hers have
confirmed a powerful source of [elestial magic](/world/species/celestial/) in a
nearby island, and that a number of its agents were moving against their
actions.

This particular angel, the [Deathengel](/world/characters/deathengel/), had been a thorn on
the side of the Reformists' goals in the Northern Lands for years, and his
appearance in the area has become of particular interest.
