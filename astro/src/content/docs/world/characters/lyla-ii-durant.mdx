Lyla Durant is the youngest daughter of
[Degare Durant](/world/characters/degare-durant/) and
[Elodië Bentayga](/world/characters/elodie-bentayga/), and was named after
Degare's younger sister [Lyla Savoy née Durant](/world/characters/lyla-durant/).

Two years ago, due to a congenital heart condition, Lyla abruptly died. After a
particularly active play session with her mother, she began breathing heavily.
Within moments, she gasped her last breaths, then collapsed.

Her mother Elodië was inconsolable after her death, and took her life soon
after. The tragedy also affected Degare Durant, the girl's father, immensely. He
became erratic, suddenly spouting conspiracies about the death of Lyla's
namesake, blaming the elder Lyla's late husband
[Percival Savoy](/world/characters/percival-savoy/).
