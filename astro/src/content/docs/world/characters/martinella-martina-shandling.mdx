*Martinella Shandling*, or more infamously *Martina*, is the proprietress of
*[The Balsawood Boad](/world/locations/the-narrows#the-balsawood-boat)*, and one
of the councilmembers of the Smugglers' Guild in
[the Narrows](/world/locations/the-narrows/). Through her money-lending services,
and her partnership with [Margaret](/world/characters/marguerite-margaret-underhand/), she
had muscled out all competition in the prostitution business in the Murmals
district.
