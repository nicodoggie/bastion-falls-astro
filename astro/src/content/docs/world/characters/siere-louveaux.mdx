<Stub />

Siere Louveaux is a nun of the Sisters of Delight, a sect within Orthodox Divine
Masochism that venerates the Angel of Delight, one of the five Angels of
Creation.

She was sent to investigate rumors that the Reformist Masochists were attempting
to spread their heresy across Apgar by first taking root in the demilitarized
Raibon Island.
