<Incomplete />

*Father Levallier de la Fouet* was a priest of the
[Orthodox Church of the Divine Masochist](/world/religions/orthodox-divine-masochist/),
and a member of the venerable [House de la Fouet](/world/families/de-la-fouet/).
He was said to have been next in line to become the *Archbishop of Sanery*, the
largest Bishopric in the [Apgarian Confederacy](/world/locations/apgar/), but had
instead chosen to be granted a position as the parish priest of the
[Church of the Angel of Justice](/world/locations/church-of-the-angel-of-justice/),
an under-served and understaffed parish in
[Port Rainoso](/world/locations/port-rainoso/),
[Raibon Island](/world/locations/raibon-island/).

He is a tall, usually gaunt, man, and is often described as older than he
appears, but his appearance immediately turns imposing once roused to anger.

# Early Career

He took the assignment to this problematic little parish after years in one of
the more prestigious churches in [Sanery](/world/locations/sanery/) ostensibly to
wind down after a somewhat tumultuous career in establishing the right to
worship a religion that is usually associated with many of the enemies of the
[Apgarian Confederacy](/world/locations/apgar/).

He had, during his short tenure as parish priest in Rainoso, grown its
membership to 150 families, excluding the tightly-knit
[Mehicanian](/world/ethnicities/mehicanian/), who often find priests from their
native country to serve them locally, a little over 3 times its previous size in
a community that was once very hostile to the Church.

He had done so by engaging with villages and homesteads outside of the primary
port town.

He is the elder brother of [Jean Paul de la Fouet](/world/characters/jean-paul-de-la-fouet/),
captain of the privateer vessel [La Carnalis](/world/organizations/la-carnalis/),
a noted *atheist*.
