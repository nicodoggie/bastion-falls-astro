Rosamunda Parvèse is the matriarch of the
[Parvèse family](/world/families/parvese/) and runs a number of establishments in
the red-light district of
[East Side of Port Rainoso](/world/locations/port-rainoso#east-side),
collectively called the
[Houses of Pleasures](/world/organizations/parvese-houses-of-pleasures/).

The middle-aged Rosemunda had brought her beleaguered family from
near-extinction at the hands of a once significant group with a vendetta against
her father. She now personally owns a sizable portion of the East Side, and
owns, or at least has a finger in, many of the establishments in Rainoso's
bugeoning red-light district. She also has an acute sense of the carnal
pleasures, and a unique ability to find new and exciting diversions.

Her Houses of Pleasure have
drawn  [L'Illes Apgarie](/world/locations/l-illes-apgarie/)'s rich and powerful
to her menagerie. These, along with her strong business-sense and uncompromising
nature, are why many consider her one of the
[Four Pillars of the East Side](/world/organizations/four-pillars-of-the-east-side/).
