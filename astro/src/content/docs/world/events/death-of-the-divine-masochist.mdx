The death of the [Arzhadadi](/world/ethnicities/arzhadadi/) man who was
eventually deified as the Divine Masochist triggered an outbreak of revolt in
the seemingly insignificant island of Arzhadad. The ensuing revolt was brought
down as a matter of course, but the events propelled the fledgling religion into
the rest of the world, eventually supplanting Kalassarian paganism almost
entirely.
