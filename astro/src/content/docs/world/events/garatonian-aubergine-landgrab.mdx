# Background

[Voracious Land Co.](/world/organizations/voracious-land-co/), a company owned by
wealthy land speculator [Lamarie DeVos](/world/characters/lamarie-devos/) found
that a [Garatonian](/world/ethnicities/garatonian/) reserve in \[Aubergine] was
seated upon a rich vein of [electrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrum).

Voracious employs a number of [Dredge Mages](/world/misc/dredge-mages/) who have
access to the spell [legend lore](https://dndbeyond.com/spells/legend-lore) to
look for areas with valuable raw materials, then he buys the land prior to
development. In this case however, the sale of lands in the Garatonian reserve
is prohibited by law, and any development must be in coordination with their
council of elders.

The Garatonian Elders voted unanimously to forbid any mining operations by
Voracious, and due to his contempt, barred DeVos from entering Aubergine
Garatonie.

# Paula Abdul

DeVos met [Paula Abdul](/world/characters/paula-abdul/) at curtain call at a
production of [Cowl of the Moonlight](/world/misc/cowl-of-the-moonlight/). Since
then, they have become frequent companions. During one of their nights out, he
had told her about the frustrating encounter with the Garatonian Elders, and
that the veins of electrum would "at least double his company's value at least
four-fold". Abdul knew of certain superstitions that might make the Garatonians
more "amenable" to exploitation.

# Performance

Abdul convinced a number of performers in the
[Guildenstern Travelling Troupe](/world/organizations/guildenstern-travelling-troupe/)
to stage a performance in the Garatonian reserve. She drafted a script about the
awakening of the [Seed of Destruction](/world/misc/seed-of-destruction/) in the
forests surrounding the prospective mines.

Immediately, the panicked Garatonians started running away, only a small few
even attempted to pack their bags in the wake of the perceived world-ending
threat. The rush to evacuate had led to a number of fires, some hurried looting
and destruction of many collectively-owned establishments.

# Aftermath

The Garatonians that survived, filed a complaint against both DeVos and Abdul in
the Aubergine capital. The court proceeding against Voracious Land Co. was
delayed for many years by DeVos' lawyers. By the time the case was settled,
DeVos had extracted 10 million gold worth of raw material, and had cause massive
environmental damage for irresponsible mining practices. Some Garatonians chose
to move back into the area, but most were forced to seek opportunities
elsewhere, due to the decreased productivity of the reserve.

Abdul did not expect the reaction to be so violent, but it was effective for
DeVos' purposes. She was given a large sum in gold, and a 10% equity in his
mining company. The performers she had used reported the matter to the
Guildensterns, who had held a meeting to discuss next steps. Abdul was invited
to come, but she did not join the proceedings. As a result, she was exiled, and
was barred from using the Guildenstern name for performances of any nature.
