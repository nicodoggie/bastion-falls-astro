<Stub />

The second in a number of attempts to retake the lands of
[Burtz](/locations/burtz/) from the warlords ant the
[Reformists](/religions/divine-masochism/reformist/) that have taken
over since the [Fall of Bastion](/events/fall-of-bastion/).

The name derives from being *Followers of the Whip*, which was a turn of phrase
to mean one who follows in the teachings of the
[Divine Masochist](/characters/divine-masochist/).
