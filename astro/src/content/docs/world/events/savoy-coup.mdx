The [Savoy](/world/families/savoy/) coup d'etat was a conspiracy that led to an
armed attempt to seize control over the
[Bouillard](/world/organizations/bouillard/) organization. Ultimately, the
attempt failed, but it had wide-ranging implications to many of its individual
members.

# Root Cause

The House of Savoy of [Rainoso](/world/locations/port-rainoso/), during the
leadership of [Lemuel Savoy](/world/characters/lemuel-savoy/) pledged their
allegiance to the Bouillard family. Agreed upon by his sisters, and his
children, the entire family have dedicated their lives to be the protectors and
helpers of the Bouillards for many generations. The House is led by the
[Pater Familius](/world/families/savoy/#pater-familius), who is typically
selected by
*[agnatic primogeniture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture)*
where the first-born male of the family would gain the title.

In breaking with tradition, Lemuel's children,
[Madison](/world/characters/madison-savoy/),
[Monroe](/world/characters/monroe-savoy/) and
[Yenna](/world/characters/yenna-savoy/) agreed that Monroe, the second child,
would become *Pater Familius* instead of the first-born Madison. This was for
two reasons:

1. Madison did not want the burden of becoming *Pater Familius*.
2. Monroe married [Nathalie Bouillard](/world/characters/nathalie-bouillard/),
   [Romulus Bouillard's](/world/characters/romulus-bouillard/) younger sister.
   This would make Monroe's line the main line of the family, and would make his
   eldest male the next to take the *Pater Familius* title.

Eventually, Madison's children learned of both the traditional primogeniture,
and of the agreement to make Monroe's line the main one. Madison's eldest child,
[Nicanor](/world/characters/nicanor-savoy/) did not really care, as he had no
interest in the position as well. [Naim](/world/characters/naim-savoy/) however,
became angry at his father, and was constantly complaining to his wife, his
children, and anyone who would care to listen to him.
[Portencia Bentayga](/world/characters/portencia-bentayga/) had similar ambitious
boasts, saying that if Bouillard blood was all it took, then her children would
have a claim as well, since she had Bouillard ancestry as well.

The claims of both Naim and Portencia would lay a seed of dissent into some of
their children, most notably on
[Percival Savoy](/world/characters/percival-savoy/), their eldest son. After
Naim's death, he and his mother began planning steps to stage a coup d'etat
against the main line of Savoys at first, then against the Bouillards
themselves.
