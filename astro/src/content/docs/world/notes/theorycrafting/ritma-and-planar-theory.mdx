## Original Development

The Kurerans developed *Ritma* as a methodology to translate Feywild magical
understanding to Theran energies. As Feywild natives, they needed a complex but
precise system based on their deep magical knowledge - similar to learning a
second language through academic study.

The development period (10,000 PF - 3,000 PF) involved extensive study of
Thera's "raw chaotic energies," which differed significantly from the Feywild's
natural magical patterns. This research culminated in the founding of
[Korad](/world/locations/korad-pass/), marking their mastery of the system.

## Kalassarian Adoption

As Thera natives, Kalassarians had natural affinity for local magical patterns.
*Ritma* gave them the framework to access their innate potential, achieving
greater raw power despite less sophisticated understanding - like native
speakers learning formal grammar of their mother tongue.

## Mathematical Expression

For a magic user attempting to access Theran magical potential T(t):

Effective Power = T(t) × A(o) × R(p) Where:

* T(t) = Raw magical potential at time t
* A(o) = Origin affinity (higher for Theran natives)
* R(p) = *Ritma* proficiency

Typical comparative values:

# Simplified representation

```
Kureran = {
    'origin_affinity': 0.6,  # Feywild native
    'ritma_proficiency': 1.0  # Original developers
}

Kalassarian = {
    'origin_affinity': 1.0,  # Theran native
    'ritma_proficiency': 0.8  # Learned system
}
```

## Planar Alignment Dependency

The effectiveness of *Ritma* techniques was intrinsically tied to specific
planar alignment conditions. Classical *Ritma* effectiveness R(t) during time t:

R(t) = Σ(pᵢ × aᵢ(t)) Where:

* pᵢ = planar influence coefficient
* aᵢ(t) = alignment factor for plane i at time t

## The Silent Ages Decline

The gradual obsolescence of *Ritma* during the Silent Ages (435-1225 AI) can be
understood as a misalignment between the original framework and shifting planar
conditions. Like using astronomical tables that become outdated, the knowledge
was preserved but no longer applicable to current conditions.

### Regional Variations

* Areas with different planar influences experienced varying rates of decline
* Some regions maintained partial effectiveness longer
* Remote areas might have developed local modifications
* Proximity to
  [Orbs of Enhancement](/world/misc/orbs-of-power/orb-of-enhancement/) could
  stabilize local conditions

## Modern Implications

The return of magic following the
[Fall of Bastion](/world/events/fall-of-bastion/) (1225 AI) doesn't represent
a return to original conditions. New planar alignments require new frameworks,
though understanding of classical *Ritma* remains valuable for theoretical
purposes.

Current magical practices likely represent a hybrid approach:

* Adaptation of classical *Ritma* principles
* New techniques developed for current planar conditions
* Integration of knowledge gained during the Silent Ages
* Understanding gained from studying
  [Orbs of Power](/world/misc/orbs-of-power/)

## Research Questions

1. How do modern planar alignments differ from those during *Ritma*'s
   development?
2. Can classical *Ritma* techniques be modified for current conditions?
3. What role do [Orbs of Power](/world/misc/orbs-of-power/) play in
   stabilizing magical access?
4. How do regional variations in magical effectiveness relate to historical
   planar alignments?
