<Stub />

Kurerans were a sub-group of [Gnomish](/world/species/gnomish) settlers who fled the
[Feywild](/world/locations/feywild/) during the
[Great Extinction](/world/events/great-fey-extinction/) brought about the conflict
between the [Dragons](/world/species/dragon) and the [Giants](/world/species/giant). Having
brought with them a deep understanding of various magical arts, they have
developed a tradition of magic that allowed them to access the unique raw
chaotic energies of the [Theran](/world/locations/thera/) plane. They called this
tradition, [Ritma](/world/concepts/ritma/).

Harnessing the power of Ritma, the Kurerans were able to expand from their first
Theran city of [Korad](/world/locations/korad-pass/) to become a major power in the
entire Beteran continent. They would found cities scattered across the
continent, not subjugating the local populations, but instead cultivating their
societies and natural tendencies to access Thera's natural chaotic energies.

# History

## The Great Fey Crossing (c. 10,000 PF)

* Gnomes flee the Feywild during the
  [Great Extinction](/world/events/great-fey-extinction/)
* Brought deep understanding of magical arts
* Initially struggled with Thera's "raw chaotic energies"
* Different from Feywild's natural magical patterns

## Adaptation Period (10,000 - 3,000 PF)

* Gnomish magical scholars study Thera's unique magical nature
* Development of techniques to harness chaotic energies
* Gradual refinement of what would become *Ritma*
* Various gnomish settlements experimenting with different approaches

## Kureran Achievement (c. 3,000 PF - 500 AI)

* Founding of [Korad](/world/locations/korad-pass/) marks mastery of *Ritma*
* Successful adaptation to Theran magic
* Begin teaching other populations to access magical energy
* Establishment of magical traditions that would influence later civilizations
* Expansion of Kureran influence across the continent

## Kalassarian Conflicts (15 - 70 AI)

The rise of the Kalassarian Empire brought the Kurerans into direct conflict
with the expanding human civilization. The First Kalassarian-Kureran War began
in 15 AI, marking the beginning of a dark period for Kureran civilization.
Despite their mastery of *Ritma* and deep understanding of Thera's magical
nature, the Kurerans found themselves increasingly isolated and overwhelmed by
the Empire's military might.

The conflict reached its tragic conclusion in 70 AI with what became known as
the Kureran Genocide. The Kalassarian Empire's systematic campaign against
Kureran settlements led to the destruction of many of their great cities,
including several magical academies that had been centers of *Ritma* study.

### The Koradin Resistance

The Kurerans of [Korad](/world/locations/korad-pass/), their first and greatest city,
proved more resilient than most. Protected by both the natural defenses of the
surrounding mountains and generations of accumulated magical fortifications, the
Koradin Kurerans maintained resistance long after other settlements fell. While
the city itself eventually succumbed to Kalassarian forces, persistent rumors
suggest that some Kureran enclaves survived deep within the mountain networks
around Korad. These hidden communities, if they exist, would represent the last
vestiges of pure Kureran culture and magical knowledge.

While some Kurerans managed to escape into remote regions like the
[Alsatian Mountains](/world/locations/alsatian-mountains/), their civilization as
it had existed was effectively destroyed.

## Legacy

The ruins of Kureran settlements continue to be discovered across the
[Beteran](/world/locations/betera/) continent, particularly in the Alsatian
Mountains. These sites have yielded valuable insights into their advanced
magical traditions and cultural practices. Recent archaeological findings
suggest that their influence on magical traditions extended far beyond their own
civilization, with elements of *Ritma* appearing in various forms throughout
later magical traditions.
