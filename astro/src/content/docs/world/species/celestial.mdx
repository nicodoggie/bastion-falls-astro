<Stub />

*Celestials* are a collection of creatures that are found primarily in the
[Celestial Planes](/world/locations/celestial-planes/), including
[Angels](/world/species/angel) and <Monster name="Pegasus" />. There are a few that
have chosen other planes, like the [Feywild](/world/locations/feywild/), such as
<Monster name="Unicorn" />.
