The Grand Convocation is a meeting of the highest-ranking members of the
[Ansa Ahuriyata](/world/religions/ahorism/caste/ansa-ahuriyata/) of the
[Ahurian Empire](/world/locations/ahuria/), often called during the death of
the King Sorha. The meeting takes place in the capital of the empire and seat of
the King, [The Island of the Gods](/world/locations/island-of-the-gods/) in
the [Sorha Principality](/world/locations/sorha/).

According to Ahurian tradition, the first Grand Convocation was called for by
the [Great Ahuriyata](/world/religions/ahorism/great-ahuriyata) himself, not only to announce that
he was to delegate his authority to his twelve eldest sons and daughters, but to
designate each and every Ahurian into the
[Grand Ordering of the World](/world/religions/ahorism/grand-ordering-of-the-world), which was the
first step in formalizing the [Ahorite](/world/religions/ahorism) tradition, and the
governance of the Ahurian Empire as a whole.
