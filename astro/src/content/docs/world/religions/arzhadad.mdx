*Mangul-am-Arzhadad* is the religion worshipped by the natives of an island off
the coast of [Giza](/world/locations/giza/) called
[Arzhadi-et-Betet](/world/locations/arzhadi-et-betet/). The religion is
considered the precursor of the Cult of the Masochist, which evolved into the
present-day [Church of the Divine Masochist](/world/religions/orthodox-divine-masochist).
from it.
