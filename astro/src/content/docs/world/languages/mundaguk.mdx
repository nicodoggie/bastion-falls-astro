The Mundaguk language is a language spoken in
[Moreaux Island](/locations/moreaux-island/), made famous by the
anthropologist [Marvin Moreaux](/characters/marvin-moreaux/) in his seminal
work, [Monsters of Moreaux Island](/misc/monsters-of-moreaux-island/).

Moreaux's book did have a short language sketch of Mundaguk, but any follow-up
research by anthropologists and linguists has been difficult, due to the
hostility of the Mundaguk natives against outsiders. He does note that the
language seems to be related to the [Estregan language](/languages/estregan), which
is noted to be a member of the [Apgarian language family](/languages/apgarian),
however some scholars from the
[University of Senera](/organizations/university-of-senera/) at
[Rannekford](/locations/rannekford/) have suggested that the language may
be related to the [Hickic Languages](/languages/hickic/).

Current research is being conducted to compare Mundaguk to a recently-unearthed
Kalassarian work on the [Early Hick language](/languages/hickic/seneran/early-hick). In
fact, the researchers purport that Moreaux may not be entirely incorrect, as
they believe that the work on Early Hick may show that the Apgarian language
family and Hickic may be more closely related than previously thought.
