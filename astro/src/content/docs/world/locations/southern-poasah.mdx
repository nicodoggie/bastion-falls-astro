Southern Poasah is a region in the western portion of the Mirian Peninsula,
bounded by the [Longissian Mountains](/world/locations/longissian-mountains) to the east.
This mountain range forms the natural border between Southern Poasah and
[Kolha](/world/locations/kolha).

The region's position west of the Longissian Mountains has historically
influenced its political and cultural development, distinct from the Kolhan
territories to the east of the range.
