<Stub /># Corrida

The country of Corrida, so named because it was a corridor between the
[Marmorantz](/world/locations/marmoranz) mountain range to the north, and the
[Mauh](/world/locations/mauh) mountain range to the south.

The landscape is dotted by many basins, waterfalls, cliffsides, and evergreen
woodlands. It was a great valley with a number of rivers and tributaries to the
Great River [Loasnah](/world/locations/loasnah) that flowed east to west down until the
[Sea of Estrus](/world/locations/sea-of-estrus), through the [Kingdom of Nura](/world/locations/nura).

Corrida did not have a formal central government, but was ruled by many smaller
polises with a shared cultural identity.
