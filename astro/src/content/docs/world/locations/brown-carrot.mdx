Brown Carrot Village is a small-sized agricultural, timber production, and
equestrian settlement in the [Acquan Region](/world/locations/acqua) of
[Poasah](/world/locations/poasah), in the outskirts of
[Acqua Termina](/world/locations/acqua-termina).

The village itself, and the lands that surround it are the possession of the
[Caxton Baronetcy](/world/families/caxton/) led by
[Lord Preston Caxton](/world/characters/lord-preston-caxton/).

One of the most notable features of the village, is that it is the base of
operations of the
[Hardpebble Trading Company](/world/organizations/hardpebble-trading-company/), owned
and operated by the eponymous [Hardpebble](/world/families/hardpebble/)Â family.
