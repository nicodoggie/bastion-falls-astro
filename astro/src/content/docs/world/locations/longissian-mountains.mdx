The Longissian Mountains are a major north-south mountain range that bisects the
Mirian Peninsula, forming the natural border between present-day
[Kolha](/world/locations/kolha) and [Southern Poasah](/world/locations/southern-poasah).

Historically, these mountains were home to
[Kureran](/world/ethnicities/koradin-kurerans/) settlements, referenced in the
[Kalassus Foundation Myth](/world-novelty/kalassus-foundation-myth/) as the
home of the "Magi Diminuti."
