*Garatoniè*, also called *La Garatoniè Apgarienne* is the partially isolated
north-western section of a group of territories called the
[Garatonian Lands](/world/locations/garatonian-lands). The territory was retained as a part
[Apgarian Confederacy](/world/locations/apgar) after the rest of the lands granted to the
nomadic [Garatonians](/world/ethnicities/garatonian/) were ceded to
[Poasah](/world/locations/poasah) under the terms of the
[Treaty of Turain](/world-novelty/treaty-of-turain/)
in 1255.
