The Kingdom of Mehicania is an independent country in the Posaran Basin with a
tumultuous history of war and conquest. Most recently in 1207, the country faced
a cultural and political revolution helmed by the
[Hermanos de la Libertad](/world/organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad/),
literally *The Brotherhood of Liberty*, which sought to overthrow the Mehicanian
Royal Family and to join the [Apgarian Confederacy](/world/locations/apgar).

### Neutrality

During the early years of the conflict, the Mehicanian Real would announce that
they would remain neutral. Though they had cultural, historical and familial
ties with the Poasan monarchy, they also had significant trade relations with
neighboring portions of the Apgarian Confederacy, particularly
[Sonima](/world/locations/sonima), which separates Mehicania with its former territory
the [Freehold of Uyama](/world/locations/uyama).

Neutrality was very unpopular not only externally, but also internally.
Monarchist Orthodox Masochists wanted the Real to formalize an alliance with
Poasah. However, a group of radicals that fostered the ideals of the old
[Hermanos de la Libertad](/world/organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad) were starting
to make a bloc within the Mehicanian Parliament. These
[Hermanos Nuevos](/world/organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad#hermanos-nuevos)
instead wanted to forge an alliance with the Apgarian Confederacy. The more
radical of the group also had the intention of overthrowing the Mehicanian
monarchy, and either joining the Apgarian Confederacy or creating a new;
government in the Apgarian model.

The stalemate in the Parliament gave the Real a moment to break neutrality and
align the country with the Kingdom of Poasah. Before they were able to announce
this, the Hermanos Nuevos were able to reveal the Real's intentions and sway
Parliament to make a declaration of neutrality as a compromise position with the
moderates within the chamber.

### Hermanos Nuevos and the Apgarian Occupation

Pablo Remedios, the leader of the Hermanos Nuevos, was voted as the the Prime
Minister of Mehicania, after a Vote of No Confidence was passed against the
Carlos Mariano of the Realista Bloc in the 11th Day of the 3rd Month of 1250 AI.
During this time, the Hermanos Nuevos were firm in their declaration of
neutrality in public, but secretly met with the leaders of the Apgarian
Confederacy to discuss a possible alliance. Some of their membership were
allowing Apgarian agents to cross the border for reconnaissance and espionage
operations.

Within the Hermanos Nuevos, were hardline independents who viewed their other
compatriots with suspicion. These
[Hermanos Tradicionales](/world/organizations/hermanos-de-la-libertad#hermanos-tradicionales)
held that the other Hermanos Nuevos were too close to the Apgarian Confederacy,
and that they were not being true to the ideals of the old Brotherhood. The
Tradicionales were mostly intellectuals from the secretive Colegio de la Salamanca
within the Universidad de Kolimenta, which secretly researched magic and
magical artifacts.

Salvador Salamanca, who wrote a manifesto on a new magocratic Mehicanian
government called *El Govierno Magocratico de la Tierra Mehicania*, found out
about the secret meetings and denounced them. This led to a split in the
Hermanos Nuevos, with the more radical members breaking away to formalize the
Hermanos Tradicionales as a separate organization, and temporarily aligned
themselves with the Realistas. However, due to massive differences in opinion
between this tenuous alliance, they were too slow to react to the Apgarian
invasion that went almost unopposed by 1252 AI.

During the Apgarian Occupation, the Hermanos Nuevos formed a puppet government
with the proviso that once the conflict ended, they would be allowed to form
an autonomous entity within the Apgarian Confederacy as the state of Apgarian
Mehicania.

## El Govierno Magocratico de la Tierra Mehicania

In 1275, the True Mehicania renamed and reformed the government into La Gobierna
Magocracia de la Tierra Mehicania, officially offering support to the Posaran
government to stifle the Northern Crisis.

The Thirteen, the Posaran military's magic division, still views them with some
suspicion, but their cooperation has forced them to hope. The Mehicanian contingent
have been deployed to ensure that the Undead Plague does not spread further south.
This marks the first time the Mehicanians established an embassy under the auspices
of their new government, and their open acknowledgment of the existence and power
of magic. The Posaran central authority often suppressed the worst in order to
explain its incompatibility with the Orthodoxy.
