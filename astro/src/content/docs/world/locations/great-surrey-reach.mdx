The Great Surrey Reach is the primary maritime artery connecting the
[Brams River](/world/locations/brams-river) to the
[Gulf of Inespell](/world/locations/gulf-of-inespell). This deep-water channel forms the
northern fork of the river's delta, separating
[Surrey-on-the-Brams](/world/locations/surrey-on-the-brams) and
[Surrey's Ear](/world/locations/surrey-on-the-brams#surreys-ear) from the Seneran mainland.

## Maritime Significance

The Reach serves as the main shipping channel for international trade and naval
operations, with depths ranging from 45 to 60 feet at mean low water and a
navigable width of nearly half a mile. Where it meets the gulf, the channel
widens into a natural deep-water roadstead, offering protected anchorage for
large vessels.

### Navigation Hazards

Several notable hazards require careful pilotage:

#### Natural Features

* Dragon's Teeth: Jagged rocks exposed at low tide near the gulf entrance
* Complex tidal interactions between river current and gulf waters
* Standing waves during ebb tides when strong southwesterly winds oppose the
  current

#### Artificial Features

* Ballast Banks: Centuries of accumulated ship's ballast creating shoals along
  the northern bank
* Strictly regulated ballast disposal points
* Maintained channels through hazardous waters

### Maritime Control

The Reach functions as a transitional zone under
[Port Surrey-on-the-Brams'](/world/locations/port-surrey-on-the-brams) authority, where:

* All vessels must submit to inspection
* Multiple inspection anchorages maintain commercial flow
* Customs officers conduct examinations
* Intelligence agents monitor for treaty violations
* Licensed pilot services guide vessels

## Strategic Importance

### Military Oversight

* Artillery batteries along both shores
* Anti-ship emplacements with overlapping fields of fire
* Quick-response naval squadrons
* Coastal watch stations
* Deep-water patrol zones

### Northern Shore

* Natural deep-water berths
* Ancient Kalassarian stone wharves
* Modern port facilities
* Military installations
* Customs checkpoints
