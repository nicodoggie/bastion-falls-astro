The *Sarmatian Sea* is a large body of salt water on the western coast of the
[Apgarian Confederacy](/world/locations/apgar), and wholly contains the island kingdom of
[Senera](/world/locations/senera). While ordinarily, the large majority of these waters
would be under the jurisdiction of the
[Apgarian Navy](/world/organizations/apgarian-military#navy), due to the war
concessions given in the [Treaty of Turain](/world/events/treaty-of-turain/),
they are patrolled almost exclusively by the
[Seneran Navy](/world/organizations/seneran-military#navy)
