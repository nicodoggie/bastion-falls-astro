The Silent Ages traditionally refer to the years between the
[Fall of the Western Kalassarian Empire](/world/events/fall-of-the-western-kalassarian-empire/)
and the [Fall of Bastion](/world/events/fall-of-bastion/). Recent scholarship
argue, however, that the age should be defined by the earliest evidence of the
disappearance of magic from Thera, and tail-ended by its return, which does
coincide with the Fall of Bastion.

This would put the earliest estimation of the Silent Ages to be from 435 AI to
1225 AI.
