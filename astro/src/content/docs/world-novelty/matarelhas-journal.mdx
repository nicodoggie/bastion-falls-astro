# 15th Sorhima of the 66th Year of the Reign of Sorha XXIII

Lady Faivalkhari is still, after one year of my tutelage, a bit on the shy side.
Slowly, however, she has made steady progress.

Today, her older brother Polhenma, the magistrate of Khan[^1], visited the
capital[^2] and brought with him his retinue. Instead of shutting herself in her
room, Fai, on her own volition, greeted him and accompanied him during her
ceremony[^3].

I am sure she will eventually be freed from her fear of intimacy of even the
familiar sort.

# 16th Sorhima of the 66th Year of the Reign of Sorha XXIII

How is it that the world of the Ansa is so different from the rest of society?
Are the walls of the palace imbued with the magics of the Gods of Old[^4] that
even the air itself transmutes into an atmosphere suitable to the Ansa's
desires? How are we, the Ahurikishki priesthood so fortunate so as to be allowed
to breathe the same air? Especially when seemingly more worthy people are barred
from these halls? The Akkibati who fight to protect our land, the Provobati who
craft our wares and build our homes, the Ponsabati who grow our food--all of
them who prove their worth day-by-day than we who serve in our position of
luxury.

Even one such as I, once a mere tool for the satisfaction of your lords' carnal
desires[^5], are elevated, where similar workers who serve men and women of
worth, are branded Harsi. My simple proximity to the heirs of the Great
Ahuriyata grant me this distinction that would otherwise be derided.

How lucky am I? That I may be selected by the priesthood to pursue scholarship
in a field of study, and one of my own choosing? That I may, only a mere months
after the completion of my studies, serve at the pleasure of one of the Ansa of
the courts as a steward of their exalted child? Then only six months to the day,
that I've been entrusted with the care of the daughter of my Prince!

# 17th Sorhima of the 66th Year of the Reign of Sorha XXIII

Spring had come somewhat late this year, but it is now definitely in full form.
The snow had all but melted, he trees are crowned once more with leaves, the
animals are out and about, feeding themselves after a long winter.

On this beautiful day, I would have felt bad if I locked Fai in a dark lecture
room. So I had moved our lecture outdoors today. It was a more impromptu lesson,
instead of the one that I had planned. It seemed appropriate for me to tailor my
lesson to the setting.

We went to the peach orchard to discuss the change of the seasons, and the
natural processes associated with them. Since we are currently experiencing this
change, I started with the transition of winter to spring. She seemed to have
enjoyed the lesson very much! Her demeanor had definitely shifted from her more
brooding, reserved self, to a more cheerful and bright one. We went through each
plant and their properties. Each tree and their health. It seemed her joviality
was infectious. I swear, the leaves seem to have become greener in her presence!

We went back to the palatial residence[^6], exhausted but, in my opinion, quite
fulfilled. I believe I will want to do more of these--perhaps even twice a week,
if the weather allows.

# 18th Sorhima of the 66th Year of the Reign of Sorha XXIII

The Lunar Festival[^7] is in twelve days, and the preparations are in full
swing! High-priest Chian had asked me to begin preparing Faivalhhari for her
role as the Spring Lord[^8]--the first prince that taught farming to the
Provobati.

*The ink on the page changed shade from a deep crimson to one with a pinkish
hue* But of course, my inkpot ran out at the most inopportune moment. This is a
slightly different shade than the one I was using unfortunately...

To continue, the Ansa's first role in the Lunar Festival is a milestone in their
special place along the Starlit Path[^9]. She, and by she, I mean Fai, and
taken her role very seriously. As soon as I have told her about it, she quickly
took to study. Currently, we are dissecting the first three stanzas of Lansa
I's address to her people:

> You who are hungry, rejoice!\
> Your hunger will be sated\
> Our Father hath mandated\
> He had took heed\
> His wisdom He bestows to all\
> Harken, for his words are sacred
>
> Gather all you men of soil\
> For you might be put to toil\
> You are akin to the ripe fruit\
> Whose seed will spread the fertile land
>
> Your worth will be proven\
> For you are the Ponsabati\
> The men of plenty\
> And you will feed His men!

She is well on her way to her successful first foray into here deific duties.

# 19th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XXIII

Perhaps I was hearing things, but was Fai reading the first Turhi's call to the
Ponsabati in the Tongue of the Ancients? When I pointed it out, she said she
didn't know what I was talking about.
I ought to have paid more attention to my classical/literature curriculum.

# 20th of Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XXIII

Chian, the high-priest of Kolha, supervised today's lesson and it somewhat made
Fai quite anxious. She kept on stuttering and forgetting lines she'd already
put to heart. I had to be a bit creative with my handling of the situation.
Fai's biggest insecurity is her heterochromia. I have tried to assure her that
the very first of her ancestors had yellow eyes, and that hers were the first
of any Ansa for close to a millenia. That it was a sign of something great in
her future! She did not take it quite well, as any teenaged person marred with
self-doubt.

So the solution happened to be tinted glasses, of the sort that the court
magicians use in their exhibitions. Surprisingly, it worked very very well.
She had a huge confidence boost from the glasses and was able to impress Chian.
I must not allow her to rely on the glasses too much. Instead of being able to
stand on her own merits, she might hold onto them like a crutch. I have to help
her boost her confidence enough somehow. Hopefully before the Lunar Festival.

# 21st of Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XXIII

Despite the proximity of the Lunar Festival in the calendar, it would not do if
my ward, Faivalkhari, was beset by fatigue due to overwork. So I have allowed
her to take the day off as would be usual for a Sunday. Of course, this gives
me time for myself as well.

It had been a long while since I had a free Sunday, hasn't it? Ever since she
accepted this posting, well, accepted might be the wrong word. I've been
appointed to it, happy as I am with the appointment. Well, ever since I have
been appointed to it, my weekends have been dedicated to preparing lesson plans,
or exercises. It's nice to just have time on my hands for personal leisure. It
was nice, yes, but I didn't know what I wanted to do with the time anymore. I
had to wrack my brain to actually figure out what to do. So I figured I would
visit my mother in the Great Monastery at Atarasha, about 3 hours from the
palace by horse. I would need permission from the high-priest, however. But
considering yesterday's results, I had confidence that I would be granted my
request.

I understand that it's rare for an Ahurikishki of my age and stature to still
be close to his mother, but she had done so very much for me, and given up more
than I could ever imagine to ensure my life would be so comfortable that I am
more than obligated to act in such a way. But that isn't why I am so fond of my
mother. She is just so full of joy that it's infectious. Any person would be
drawn in and would be able to be forever without her. Fai could learn a thing or
two from herâ€”forgive me, ill of me to suggest that a piece of the essence of
creation can learn from her own creation, but our gods are limited by their
earthly form that when they are teenagers, they act like the rest of humanity's
teenagers. Unsure, defensive, filled with thoughts they cannot yet direct.

In any case, I had, as soon as I could, asked for the high priest's permission
to leave the palace. It was granted with a caveat. I was told to bring a
package to the Head Abbott of the monastery. Package not to be opened, not to
be given to anyone else, just given to the Head Abbot himself. Some secret
between old people. Far from me to deny the high-priest a simple favor such as
that. I made the preparations as soon as I had the clearance.

Once the carriage arrived, I was on my way to the Grand Monastery. It isn't my
first time, of course. I had visited my mother many a time already. It would
be the first time I visit during preparations for a major festival though. It
definitely felt different. A large number of Provobati merchants, tailors and
carpenters flooded the gates, Konti Kirsharti in tow, carrying their wares into
the Monastery grounds, as the craftspeople spun them into beautiful tableaus
and altars that the Ansa would be using for their prayers. Ponsabati
horticulturists were adorning every inch with marigolds, jasmines, and various
orchids. Spice harversters placed their bags of turmeric, paprika, and all sorts
of fragrances that give praise to the great diversity of Lord Yatahari's
creation. The Akkibati guard all ensure that all are what they seem and who they
say they are. Of course, that meant that I was thoroughly searched as well. It
would not do if any of the Divine Masochist separatists were to infiltrate the
monastery at all. Any sort of violence during the Lunar Festival would be
inauspicious.

The Akkibati first did not appreciate the fact that I was carrying a package
whose contents I did not know. After I had authenticated myself, and that the
package is indeed from the Prince's high-priest herself, they let me in without
further question.

When I got to the Pleasure House, my mother was out doing her duty. Knowing my
mother, she would be taking her time, so I had to wait a while. (Just as well,
I was able to finish the short errand that Chian wanted me to complete. I
headed to the central pavilion to deliver the package. The Head Abbot was
speaking with the head of security when I arrived. He promptly left as I
arrived. We did the customary formal greetings before I presented the package.
He took it with thanks, then hid it before engaging in some polite, yet
pleasant banter. Which meant, unfortunately, that it was devoid of meaningful
content. I excused myself and went back to the Presume House in hopes that my
mother is done with her obligations.

With some relief, I saw my mother right away who greeted me warmly. We talked
for hours on end about the Festival, about Fai, about the state of the
princedom and about her place here in the Great Monastery. She was,
apparently, a favorite of the 6th daughter of Kolha XVIII and had served her
regularly. It is interesting to note that even if Seserave did not join her
siblings in rebellion 20 years ago, she did believe in the cause they fought.
She often complained to mother after several acts that Kolha would've been
better off in open rebellion against the homeland, and that the current prince
would realize it as well as they have. She just feared that by then it would
be too late. I hope that such worrisome things do not come to pass before Fai
is ready, though. She still has more to learn. The concerning rumors about the
king's health, I pray, are exaggerated.

After all that, we had a private dinner in her chambers. We had a lovely duck
with lotus served to us, with a light herb salad. The herb, of course, had
been blanched with alkalines to dull most of its effects, then flavored with a
tarragon vinaigrette. A lovely dinner, to be sure. We reminisced about events
vague to my memory. Times before mother was forced into the monastery for the
sake of a peaceful transition of the priesthood. What I know, however, was
that I was allowed to stay in the palace as a result of my mother's dealings.

After the dinner, we said our goodbyes. She gave me a small bottle of a red
liquid. She said a trader from Columty gave it to her, and that it had potent
properties that so defied the realm of possibility, that it would likely just be
some spiced wine. I graciously accepted anyway. Then I was off. Back to the
palace, ready to face tomorrow's responsibilities.

# 22nd Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

Today, one of Fai's sisters joined us during training. Chariharti was just as
reserved and quiet as she was six months agoâ€”and is still in some respects
these days, to be honestâ€”but it really is uncharacteristic of many Ansa I've
met over the years. Even those I have had a hand in training. These two do not
have an air of natural... arrogance that most people who happen to be gods can
be. Others may find it ungod-like, but I do find it refreshing myself. They do
need some guidance to help them with their confidence. Fai does have me to
help her actualize her potential to be a god. Chariharti will only turn 12 in
the 5th Sorhima. She would only receive her mentor in two years. She is still
taught to speak and read by a house tutor with other little Ansa.

Anyway, the two had been somewhat familiar with each other due to being sisters
for one. But it seems like they warmed more as former classmates in primary education. It is such a peculiarity of Ansa
society that filial piety to their siblings is almost nonexistent. The very
competitive nature of the Tonoreyata Primogeniture keeps them from being more
connected. I wonder if the Great Ahuriyata, in His infinite wisdom, intended it
as many scholars and philosophers suppose. If anyone reads this borderline
heresy, I may actually be put to death, or thrown into the House of Harsi. I do
not mean it that way however. I question the interpretation. Are people with
power truly less prone to conspiring to gain power if they mistrust their
siblings? I do not believe so. Our own history disproves this. What we know of
Ansan regional politics also is a good argument against. It would be heresy, in
my opinion, if our Grand Lord did not foresee the events that have taken place.
There must be some other reason for the Tonoreyata.

This is all to say that I wish these two may become friends.

# 23rd Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

It's about a week left before the Lunar Festival begins and Fai's role as the
god of plenty, Tunhi I. So now we are continuing on working on her stage
presence. Her confidence is still quite lacking in many regards, but it is
improving, and she seems to be really trying hard recently, especially on
getting her performance just right. There was something about her purpose that
is just admirable. She seems to have some... inspiration, I want to say? Does
she want to show off to her mother?

# 24th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

The first dress rehearsal for the festival rites starts today and I found Fai
sneaking around in the Higher Ansa chamber before it started. When I saw her,
she seemed flustered and out of sorts. I don't know if she saw me, or heard me
calling to her, but she ran past me. Did she have tears in her eyes?

I was in the Chambers to present myself to the Prince. Although she ought to
already have the itinerary for the festivities, since her high-priest had
prepared most of what would be happening. But forms must be followed, and so I
must present Fai's parts in all of it. So I went on about the day including her
portions.

# 25th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

I have recently come across a recipe for a type of indelible ink called an Oak
Gall Ink from a couple of potted documents I've been asked to rearrange in the
archives by an old friend of mine who requested for help. And by recently, I
mean close to a year now. I have had so little time for myself recently that I
had not tried it.

We have had the fortunate pleasure of leaving the palace today that I was able
to, instead, purchase a bottle of this lovely ink from a Nuran merchant. I
would assume that this ink, which I am writing this document with, would prove
to be of much better quality than if I myself would've mixed it. It is a lovely
pure color that darkens as it dries. It anyhow, it is quite magical, to my
eyes.

We have come to the site of the Lunar Festival's traditional celebratory temple
here in Kolha: the Father's Campground. The supposed site of the Great One's
pavilion during the final campaign to capture what had become Kolha's capital
city.

Sisters Faivalkhari and Chariharti had come to the temple together, chaperoned
by yours truly, and escorted by a pair of their mother's Akkibati honor guard.
Yesterday, the dress rehearsal at the palace was quite successful, and so none
were anticipating issues. Now that I look at my previous entry. I seem to have
cut it short. (I forgot to fill it in!). Of course, the slightly different
arrangement on the actual venue was enough to confuse people and create minor
issues. All of them likely resolvable by tomorrow, once people adopt to the new
stage.

As for Fai, she seems very determined to get things right, and performed
admirably. She anticipated the changes and acted appropriately. She'd
enunciated well and with variation, passion. I could not have asked for a
better performance. I am so proud of her progress.

However, her behavior outside of the Lunar Festival is quite different too. She
seems to be distracted outside of her practice. As I watch her looking into the
residences, and staring as if expecting something or someone to show up.

# 26th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

4 more days until the Festival (another abrupt ink, well, pen change) begins
and we are ready. It's quite exciting isn't it, though? The commoners certainly
think so. It's quite rare for them to experience something from their gods,
much less have their gods perform for them at all.

Provobati merchants, artisans, and craftsmen start to bring their equipment,
their materials and some of their completed wares for sale upon the arrival of
the visitors entering the temple grounds. Akkibati guard from both the Great
Monastery and the Khare stand by every ingress and egress point, some are on
patrol all over the place to ensure that any troublemakers that may have slipped
in through the inevitable gaps are caught and stopped before they could cause
significant harm.

In particular, Divine Masachist separatists have been causing a significant and
disruptive amount of damage in the Kolhan countryside. It's been discovered that
they might attack the capital during the festivities. There is even some
evidence that they are being bankrolled by Suman Purchansa. Security is very
tight and because of all of these issues.

Today, we are still going through a series of rehearsals, including a dress and
make-up one. I might not strictly be necessary in today's events, but I like to
be supportive of my wards. Fai is not so fragile anymore but I still want to be
there for her for motivation and support. Also, the amphitheatre is quite cool
and relaxing on a nice spring day like this one. I definitely would not mind
sitting down there at all.

I'm not quite sure where my mind is at the moment. I wrote the last paragraph as
if it hadn't happened yet. Those all happened earlier today of course. I have
these disconcerting lapses of a sense of time still, but I definitely no longer
have large tracts of my memory anymore. Not since that time three years ago.
Even then that was a one-off since Fai left from Citylord Perenelha's service.
I do not remember a whole lot of my time there anymore, but the end of my time
there, was confusing at best.

That was quite a tangent.

I then did just what I said I did in the former paragraph: I brought this
portable pen I was able to purchase from one of those merchants I was talking
about. It's a wonderful invention which stores the ink in a reservoir within
the barrel. Instead of a reed, an analogue forged from gold is placed on the
tip.

The writing is smooth, without the typical scratch of a peacock feather, or some
other quill. The mechanism is quite ingenious, actually. The body is turned into
a nice cylindrical shape from some matured amber. Another is turned into some
kind of shroud that can be twisted to seal the pen in order to protect the
"reed" from damage. Inside the "barrel," there is a small pouch of gut that can
hold the ink. You can pour some ink with a needle of brass. You then attach the
section where the "reed" is mounted, let the ink flow through the channels
carved into some hard wax by sealing it downwards. Now as it flows through, into
the "reed", you can write!

<Image src={penDiagram} alt="Fountain Pen Diagram" />

It was quite convenient. In fact, I am using it writing with it even right now.
You'd think it was magical, the way it works! Anyone who saw me asked where the
inkwell was!

In any case, during this entire rehearsal, the high-priest's attendant Shiranaya
sat next to me. This year, she reminded me that the king would be visiting the
Lunar Festival in Kolha. However, he would be unable to make it due to his
illness. I told her, of course, that we have been told this already, and have
not been expecting the king at all during the preparations, then why mention
the fact again?

She then went on a rage, saying that she did not want to leave Kolha at all, and
that the king was not young at his 66th year. And then she calmed down,
composed herself, and left. It perplexed me to no end. We were definitely not
close. Sure, we had been acquainted for as long as I've been alive, but we've
never been in each other's confidence. Why did she choose to rant in front of
me?

Fai, after the rehearsal, said that she was tired, and wanted to bathe in the
hot spring alone today. She then straight to her chambers right after. I let
her do as she pleased. She did well today.

# 27th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

These new pens are really enjoyable to me. The "reed," or nib, as the craftsman
called it, holds a line more consistently, and does not need replacement
constantly. The man actually is able to grind the tip of the nib in different
ways, with different thicknesses and shapes, which have implications on the page
based on writing style and angle. It makes for interesting line variation. I am
enjoying the experience immensely. Perhaps I might improve upon my calligraphy.

Three days left until the Lunar Festival, and many of the provincial Ansa are
arriving. For some reason Fai had begun showing undue interest in every new
arrival, but is disappointed upon seeing the face of each individual. She is
looking for someone, expecting their arrival, but sad to see someone else in
their stead. I wonder who it is she is looking for, and if we could, perhaps
arrange an acceptable match? It is not my place, for sure, but I do prefer that
she matches with someone she cares for, if at all possible. It might be
possible, since our prince, Fai's mother, has little interest in political games
others make quite some sport of. There might be a good chance for her to marry
whoever she wishes, especially as she would be unmarched.

Nothing of particular note regarding rehearsals, however. Only to say that they
are on track for a grand performance. Tomorrow would be of note, for sure, as
the Ant Magicians would begin pyrotechnic rehearsals.

# 28th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

The Great One has deigned to save us today! From a mishap owing to some
mistaken mix of black powder, the explosion that was to be the centrepiece of
the performance burned a large part of the stage. Many of the performers have
been caught in the blaze. Miraculously, no one was hurt. Least of all, our very
own Faivalkhari. In fact, she had been helping those who seemed to have been the
closest to the blast. As I ran to the stage to get her out of the way, she was
already doing the same for many others. They appear to have been hurt at first
until she holds their arms to carry them. For some reason I see both her eyes
glow a bright yellow-white, speckles reflecting the flames around her. She
looked the most divine god I have ever seen!

By instinct, I had believed it was the safest in the area surrounding Fai. Those
I had hoped, I brought there. Then, as the Akkibati had arrived to douse the
flames, the area around Fai was unburnt, the people with nary a scratch, as the
healers assured them. Then she passed out. There was something important that
happened that day. Fai had, perhaps, demonstrated why we venerate our Ansa
Ahuriyata.

# 29th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

I am still taking stock of the events of yesterday's events. The explosion that
had happened on stage during the last dress rehearsal had the entire royal
family and the Ansa court rocked to their core. Security around the Great
Monastery had increased tenfold to find and root out potential terrorists. None
had taken credit for the explosion as of yet, but the primary suspects are
members of the Knights of Kalassarian Paladins, a particularly violent
separatist group from the Kalissan Hills near the Kalamban border. They have
been agitating recently, hijacking among caravans and for collection carriages,
as well as pushing for the creation of a separate kingdom from within the
territories with a population of Orthodox Masochists. Hopefully, we'll know
about this stuff by tomorrow, before the opening ceremony begins.

I still don't know how to take the entire set of events yesterday. Did I just
imagine the things that I saw? That Fai's eyes glowed both a golden yellow?
That she had been the one to close the wounds of those who might have been
hurt? For a moment, I thought that the Great One himself had stopped the blaze.
Fai recovered just a few hours after these events. She doesn't seem to remember
anything from yesterday's events. Well, anything that might be considered
miraculous, anyway.

She maintains that she can continue with tomorrow's performance, and wishes me
to quickly run her through the entire performance before she takes the rest of
the day off to recover. Meanwhile, the stage is hurriedly being reworked to
ensure that there are no traces of damage once the people come in.

# 30th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII. The Day of the Lunar Festival

Magnificent! Today's events have gone off without a hitch! Not only did the
people love the preparations done on the side-attractions, they have been
enthralled by the troupe's wonderful performance. Fai in particular was the
epitome of grace and confidence. She, for the moment on stage, was the first
Tunhi herself. The way she bore herself, the way she talked, the way she
elocuted the address to the first of the Ponsaâ€”she cannot be denied the title
of Godhead at that very moment.

Of course, I got ahead of myself. Today was a special day, and deserves to be
recorded in more detail, including some background on things that could have
gone wrong if certain actions weren't taken. Let's start from the beginning of
the day.

Unlike a typical morning, I am not the one in charge of morning preparations.
It was the attendant Shiranaya who had also been charged with handling the coordination between the
different Ansa delegations. She knocked on Fai's door as I joined the bathing
entourage. I caught one of them staring at me, then she snickered for some
inexplicable reason. By then, Fai opened the door to let us all into the
chamber. We went through the motions of ceremony while Fai again whispers "why
is this necessary again?" to which I merely smiled and told her "we've
discussed this many times before." She just pouts and says "well, I still think
it's annoying. Tomorrow, as soon as I'm done with all this, I'm forbidding this
long form prayer." She recently found out that she could. For the sake of the
attendants' faith and practice, however, we'll try to convince her otherwise.

Of course, as is typical for her, she got bashful as soon as the bathing
attendants wheeled her toward the bath. She allows only female bathers and
dressing attendants and does her camisole and loin cloth herself. It isn't so
unusual, really, just among Ansa. During this time, I had a floating feeling
that I was forgetting something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Just
thought to log it, in case I remember it later.

After the primping and polishing, she was spirited into the Prince's receiving
room, where the other Ansa are already waiting. Among them, the most notable
are the Prince herself, her childrenâ€”Fai's siblings, and some members of the
Gyan court. A Kolhan delegation was supposed to join as well, but the King's
sudden illness probably took utmost priority that none of the other delegates
thought it in poor taste to travel until he recovers.

Fai was ushered in before her younger sisters. Each Ansa was flanked by their
attendants. These were Jana and Huala who both bowed in reverence to the small
convocation of the pantheon in their presence. What's odd is that, as we lifted
our heads, Fai's face seems to have flashed with a vicious glare. But when was
it directed, exactly? I cautiously scanned the room as the... anger? On her
face was marked by passivity. Her yellow eye still somehow, was filled with
emotion.

High Priest Chianpasha addressed the room as she began the traditional
explanation on the importance of this festival, and their role in this event.
How the Ansa represent the first Tunhi, function as the Great Ahuriyata's envy.
Something about Chian had always discomforted me somehow. Today, as she was
going through all that, it seems like I finally have some insight into why. She
was as cold as she described events of reverence, as if her years have beaten
out the passion in her belief. And I know for a fact that her "passions" can
still be so expressive even at her age. She was a frequent visitor in the
Pleasure House when I was still in that line of work. Still, with someone so
passionate, her presence was so demanding that she could not be ignored.

# 1st Tunhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha

I did not really expect to write an entry today because today is a mostly
uneventful one. Fai didn't really want to do anything interesting after the
excitement of the past few days. Fai definitely needed today's respite.
