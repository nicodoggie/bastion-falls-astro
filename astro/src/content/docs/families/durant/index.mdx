The Durant family originally hail from mainland
[Sanery](/locations/sanery/) and were staunch anti-Masochist. During the
[Battles for the Masochist](/events/battles-for-the-masochist/) in the
1000s that made the [de la Fouet](/families/de-la-fouet/) family famous, the
Durants, amongst others moved to
[Raibon Island](/locations/raibon-island/) in protest. The thought was,
that they would eventually mount a counter-offensive to suppress the Masochistas
in the mainland. They ultimately failed to mount any sort of resistance, as
fielding soldiers proved difficult.

Most present-day Durants are still of the
[Apgarian Paganist](/religions/paganism/apgarian/) persuasion,
with notable exceptions being a branch who had married into the
[McFarland](/families/mcfarland/) family, as they follow
[Northern Paganist](/religions/paganism/northern/) traditions.
