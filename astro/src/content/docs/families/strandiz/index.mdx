The Strandiz family is an [Anasaian](/locations/anasai/) family
well-known for their long military tradition. Their progenitor,
[Matthew I Strandiz](/characters/matthew-i-strandiz/), came to
prominence by saving the life of then crown prince Hudor of Anasai. Since then,
the Strandiz men have served in various militaries throughout Apgarian history.
