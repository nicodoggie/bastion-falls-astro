The *Bouillard* family leads an organized crime organization based in the
[East Side of Port Rainoso](/locations/port-rainoso#east-side). Founded
in 1104 by
[Bertrand Maximilian Th√©odore Bouillard](/characters/bertrand-bouillard/),
he brought together 3 different ships, formerly of the
[Kincade Enterprises](/organizations/kincade-enterprises/) pirate fleet,
to do coordinated smuggling runs across the
[Sarmatian Sea](/locations/sarmatian-sea/).

Originally, their base of operations was on an atoll that eventually became
[L'ille Descargar](/locations/descargar-atoll/) due to the difficulty
for the larger *Seneran Frigates* to traverse the waters surrounding it, and to
hide from the Kincades, who were not familiar with the islands south of
[Raibon Island](/locations/raibon-island/). They would eventually move
to [Port Rainoso](/locations/port-rainoso/) to hide in plain sight as an
official shipping company, despite still trading in contraband and smuggling, to
the dismay of the Kincades.
