does Astro provide a function for slugifying strings?

I will search the web to see if Astro provides a built-in function for
slugifying strings.

Based on the search results, Astro does not provide a built-in, top-level
function for slugifying strings directly accessible like `Astro.slugify()`.

However, Astro uses `rehype-slug` internally for generating slugs for markdown
headings. While you can't directly call Astro's internal slugify function for
arbitrary strings in your components, you have a few options:

1.  **Use a library:** Install a popular slugify library like `slugify` or
    `github-slugger` (which `rehype-slug` uses) via npm/yarn/pnpm and use it in
    your Astro components or utility functions. The search result "Generating
    Slug From Title In Astro - equk's blog" shows an example of creating a
    custom `createSlug` function using basic string manipulation, and another
    result mentions using the `slugify` library specifically for handling
    different languages like Russian.
2.  **Write your own function:** Create a simple utility function to handle
    slugification based on your specific needs, similar to the example in the
    "Generating Slug From Title In Astro" blog post.

For generating slugs specifically for markdown content headings within Astro's
content collections or markdown pages, Astro handles this automatically. There
was a discussion (Issue #3468) about allowing custom slugify functions for
markdown, and while Astro itself didn't add a direct API, a community plugin
`@microflash/rehype-slugify` was mentioned as a way to achieve this if the
default behavior isn't sufficient.

I'm getting a weird error here `Expected "}" but found ":"`

Okay, let's fix this.

The error `Expected "}" but found ":"` is happening because the TypeScript code
for defining the props (`interface Props { ... }`) and the logic using
`Astro.props` needs to be inside the frontmatter script block (`--- ... ---`) at
the top of your `.astro` file.

Additionally, the way `rehype-slug` is being used (`rehypeSlug(name)`) is
incorrect. `rehype-slug` is a rehype plugin meant to be used within the Markdown
processing pipeline, not as a direct function call to slugify a string.

As we discussed previously, Astro doesn't have a built-in slugify function. A
good approach is to use a dedicated library like `slugify`.

First, let's install the `slugify` library. I'll propose the command to run in
your terminal.
