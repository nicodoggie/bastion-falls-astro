PanZoom doesn't seem to properly load, but no errors are emitted

Okay, let's look into why the `PanZoom` component might not be working as expected.

Often, when using interactive components from frameworks like React within Astro, you need to explicitly tell Astro to load and hydrate the component on the client-side. This is done using client directives.

I'll add the `client:load` directive to your `PanZoom` component in `src/content/docs/families/bentayga/index.mdx`. This directive ensures the component's JavaScript is loaded and executed as soon as the page loads.

```diff
    zoomMax={10}
    zoomMin={0.1}
+   client:load
  >
    <Element id="tree">
```

---

I've added the `client:load` directive. Please check if the `PanZoom` component works correctly now.
