# Type Declaration Troubleshooting (2025-05-04 19:47Z)

_**User (2025-05-04 10:30Z)**_

for some reason, even if we have type declarations in the @types  project directory, it can't find it in cli. am I doing something wrong?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help investigate this issue. First, I'll check the types package structure and configuration.


---

Read file: /home/ensu/Projects/bastion-falls-astro/packages/types/package.json

---

Let me also check the CLI's package.json to see how it's referencing the types package.


---

Read file: /home/ensu/Projects/bastion-falls-astro/cli/package.json

---

I can see a few potential issues:

1. The types package's `exports` field in package.json is incorrectly configured. It's currently:
```json
"exports": {
  ".": "./dist/*"
}
```
This should be:
```json
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
    "import": "./dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

2. The CLI is correctly referencing the types package with `"@bastion-falls/types": "workspace:*"`, but the types package needs to be built before it can be used.

Let me check if the types package has been built:


---

| üìÑ `index.js` |
| üìÅ `old` |

</details>

---

The types package has been built, but there might be an issue with the exports configuration. Let me fix that:

Now that I've fixed the exports configuration, you'll need to:

1. Rebuild the types package:
```bash
cd packages/types && pnpm build
```

2. Rebuild the CLI package:
```bash
cd ../../cli && pnpm build
```

The issue was that the types package's exports field wasn't properly configured to expose both the TypeScript types and the JavaScript module. The new configuration explicitly tells Node.js where to find both the types and the module code.

After rebuilding both packages, the TypeScript error should be resolved. Let me know if you still encounter any issues!

_**User (2025-05-04 10:30Z)**_

@tsconfig.json I do want the output of the project into dist to mirror the dir structure, I suppose this means we have to change moduleResolution from bundled to something else, correct? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you're correct. The `moduleResolution: "bundler"` setting is more suited for bundling applications rather than building libraries with a mirrored directory structure. For your use case, you'll want to use `"node16"` or `"nodeNext"` which better handle ESM packages and maintain directory structure.

Let me check the types package's tsconfig as well to ensure consistency:


---

Read file: /home/ensu/Projects/bastion-falls-astro/packages/types/tsconfig.json

---

I see that the types package is already using `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"`, which is good. Let's update the CLI's tsconfig to match this approach:

</details>

---

These changes will:

1. Use `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"` which is better suited for ESM packages and will help maintain directory structure
2. Set `"module": "NodeNext"` to match the module resolution strategy
3. This will work better with your workspace setup and the types package

After making these changes, you should:

1. Clean your dist directories
2. Rebuild both packages:
```bash
pnpm -r build
```

The output in the dist directory should now better mirror your source directory structure. The `NodeNext` resolution strategy is also more compatible with how Node.js handles ESM packages, which is important since both your packages are using `"type": "module"` in their package.json files.

Let me know if you need any clarification or run into any issues!

_**User (2025-05-04 10:30Z)**_

tsx doesn't seem to follow the paths compilerOptions

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, `tsx` needs additional configuration to understand TypeScript path aliases. You'll need to use the `tsconfig-paths` package to make it work with `tsx`. Let me help you set that up:

1. First, let's install the required package:


---

```bash
cd cli && pnpm add -D tsconfig-paths
```

---

_**User (2025-05-04 10:30Z)**_

installed now

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now we need to modify the `dev` script in the CLI's package.json to use `tsconfig-paths` with `tsx`. Let me check the current script:


---

Read file: /home/ensu/Projects/bastion-falls-astro/cli/package.json

---

Let me update the `dev` script to use `tsconfig-paths`:

Now when you run `pnpm dev`, `tsx` should properly resolve the path aliases defined in your tsconfig.json. The `--require tsconfig-paths/register` flag tells `tsx` to use the path mappings from your TypeScript configuration.

Try running `pnpm dev` now and the path aliases like `@/*` and `@lib/*` should work correctly. Let me know if you still encounter any issues!

---

_**User (2025-05-04 10:30Z)**_

ok, now it isn't  finding tsconfig.json for some reason

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. Since we're using ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json), we need to use the ESM version of tsconfig-paths. Let's modify the dev script to use the correct import:

This change uses the ESM loader approach instead of the CommonJS require approach. The `--loader` flag is the ESM equivalent of `--require` and should work better with your ESM setup.

Try running `pnpm dev` again. If you still have issues, we might need to try an alternative approach using `tsx`'s built-in path resolution. Let me know what happens!

---

_**User (2025-05-04 10:30Z)**_

ok so does tsup always destroy dist output directory structure?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the tsup configuration and behavior. Looking at your current tsup config in package.json:

```json
"tsup": {
  "entry": [
    "src/bin/cli.ts",
    "src/bin/bash-complete.ts"
  ],
  "format": [
    "esm"
  ],
  "tsconfig": "src/tsconfig.json",
  "clean": true,
  "sourcemap": true,
  "splitting": true,
  "minify": false
}
```

Yes, by default tsup will flatten the output structure unless you configure it otherwise. To maintain the directory structure, you'll need to add the `outDir` option and set `splitting` to `false` (since splitting can affect directory structure). Let me modify the tsup config:

_**User (2025-05-11 07:41Z)**_

is there a way to use remark to insert `<Stub />` tags into files with empty contents

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we can use remark to detect empty content and insert `<Stub />` tags. We'll need to create a custom remark plugin for this. Let me help you modify the scan command:

We need to install a few additional dependencies for the types. Let me add those:


---

```bash
cd cli && pnpm add -D @types/mdast unist-util-visit
```

---

_**User (2025-05-11 07:41Z)**_

oh ok, so basically we'll have to make an entire plugin for it. got it. thanks!

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, exactly! The approach I showed creates a custom remark plugin that:

1. Uses `unist-util-visit` to traverse the AST
2. Checks if there's any content besides frontmatter (ignoring thematic breaks)
3. If no content is found, injects a `<Stub />` MDX component

The plugin structure is pretty straightforward:
```typescript
function remarkStub() {
  return (tree: Root) => {
    let hasContent = false;
    visit(tree, (node) => {
      if (node.type !== 'yaml' && node.type !== 'thematicBreak') {
        hasContent = true;
      }
    });
    if (!hasContent) {
      tree.children.push({
        type: 'mdxJsxFlowElement',
        name: 'Stub',
        attributes: [],
        children: []
      });
    }
  };
}
```

You can then use it in your remark pipeline with `.use(remarkStub)`. This is a common pattern in the remark ecosystem - each plugin is just a function that returns a transformer function that operates on the AST.

Let me know if you want to explore any other remark plugin features or need help with the implementation!
