  literally *The Brotherhood of Liberty*, which sought to overthrow the Mehicanian
  Royal Family and to join the [Apgarian Confederacy](/locations/apgar).
+ 
+ ## The Mehicanian Magecracy
+ 
+ How has no one heard of these people?
+ 
+ The Mehicania is most well-known as the neutral party during the Apgarian-Posaran
+ conflict. The fact that the government stayed neutral was a point of annoyance to a
+ few groups within their borders. Orthodox Masochists wanted to force the government
+ to announce an alliance with Posash, but the radical hard leftists opposed them in
+ Parliament, to attempt forging, and perhaps even joining the Apgarian Federation.
+ The moderates, however, could not work out due to the ensuing stalemate due to the
+ hard leftists. That is, a small faction within that group, known as the Apgarian
+ Syndicalists, did not trust a small group that wanted to ensure Mehicanian
+ independence. This group was officially called the True Mehicania party, who
+ believed they had much to lose by joining either of the rival nations in the
+ conflict.
+ 
+ These people were intellectuals from the Universidad de la Suficiencia Progresiva.
+ Many of them have been researching magic in secret. That is, until the party's
+ takeover of the Mehicanian government in 1270.
+ 
+ In 1275, the True Mehicania renamed and reformed the government into La Gobierna
+ Magecracia de la Tierra Mehicania, officially offering support to the Posaran
+ government to stifle the Northern Crisis.
+ 
+ The Thirteen, the Posaran military's magic division, still views them with some
+ suspicion, but their cooperation has forced them to hope. The Mehicanian contingent
+ have been deployed to ensure that the Undead Plague does not spread further south.
+ This marks the first time the Mehicanians established an embassy under the auspices
+ of their new government, and their open acknowledgment of the existence and power
+ of magic. The Posaran central authority often suppressed the worst in order to
+ explain its incompatibility with the Orthodoxy.
