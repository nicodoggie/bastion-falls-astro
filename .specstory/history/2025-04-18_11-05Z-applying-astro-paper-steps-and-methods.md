_**User (2025-04-18 11:05Z)**_

how exactly do I apply astro-paper here? do I have to redo everything and apply a template? or can I just import astro paper like a library?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to integrate the `astro-paper` theme into their existing Astro project located at `/home/ensu/Projects/bastion-falls-astro`. They want to know if it requires starting over with a template or if it can be added like a library.

1.  **Understand `astro-paper`:** I need to know what `astro-paper` is and how it's typically used. Is it a full theme/template, a component library, or something else? A web search would be helpful here.
2.  **Check Project Structure:** The user is in `src/pages/blog/index.astro`, which is currently empty. This suggests they might be starting the blog section or the whole project. Knowing the overall project structure might be helpful (`list_dir`).
3.  **Integration Method:** Based on what `astro-paper` is, I can determine the integration method.
    *   If it's a full theme/template, it usually means replacing existing layouts, styles, and possibly configurations. It might be easier to start *from* the template.
    *   If it's a component library or integration, it might be possible to add it to an existing project by installing it, configuring it, and using its components/layouts.
4.  **Provide Guidance:** Explain the options to the user based on the findings.

**Plan:**

1.  Use `web_search` to understand `astro-paper` and its typical integration process.
2.  Based on the search results, explain the integration options to the user. If it *can* be added like a library, explain the general steps (install, configure, use components/layouts). If it's best used as a template, explain that too.</details></think>

Okay, let's figure out how `astro-paper` works. I'll search the web to understand its integration process.
