Based on the search results, Astro does not provide a built-in, top-level
function for slugifying strings directly accessible like `Astro.slugify()`.

However, Astro uses `rehype-slug` internally for generating slugs for
markdown headings. While you can't directly call Astro's internal slugify
function for arbitrary strings in your components, you have a few options:

1.  **Use a library:** Install a popular slugify library like `slugify` or
    `github-slugger` (which `rehype-slug` uses) via npm/yarn/pnpm and use it
    in your Astro components or utility functions. The search result
    "Generating Slug From Title In Astro - equk's blog" shows an example of
    creating a custom `createSlug` function using basic string manipulation,
    and another result mentions using the `slugify` library specifically for
    handling different languages like Russian.
2.  **Write your own function:** Create a simple utility function to handle
    slugification based on your specific needs, similar to the example in the
    "Generating Slug From Title In Astro" blog post.

For generating slugs specifically for markdown content headings within Astro's
content collections or markdown pages, Astro handles this automatically. There
was a discussion (Issue #3468) about allowing custom slugify functions for
markdown, and while Astro itself didn't add a direct API, a community plugin
`@microflash/rehype-slugify` was mentioned as a way to achieve this if the
default behavior isn't sufficient.

I'm getting a weird error here `Expected "}" but found ":"`

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is reporting a linter error `Expected "}" but found ":"` in the file `src/components/Spell.astro`.

Looking at the provided code:
```astro
import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";

interface Props {
  name: string;
}

const { name } = Astro.props;

const slug = rehypeSlug(name);

<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/{slug}" target="_blank">
  {name}
</a>
```
The error points to line 4 (`name: string;`). This indicates a syntax issue within the `Props` interface definition.

The interface definition `interface Props { name: string; }` looks correct for standard TypeScript. However, Astro components have specific ways of defining props.

Astro components define props using `interface Props { ... }` within the frontmatter script (`--- ... ---`). The code provided shows the interface *outside* the frontmatter.

Let's examine the structure again:
1.  `import rehypeSlug from "rehype-slug";` - Import statement.
2.  `interface Props { ... }` - Interface definition.
3.  `const { name } = Astro.props;` - Accessing props.
4.  `const slug = rehypeSlug(name);` - Calling the imported function (This is likely incorrect usage, `rehype-slug` is a rehype plugin, not a direct slugify function).
5.  HTML template part.

The key issue seems to be that the interface definition and the logic using `Astro.props` are outside the frontmatter script block (`---`).

Also, the usage of `rehypeSlug(name)` is incorrect. `rehype-slug` is a plugin for the rehype processor, designed to work within the Markdown/MDX processing pipeline. It doesn't expose a standalone function to slugify a string directly like this.

The linter error itself (`'}' expected.`) might be slightly misleading due to the context shift outside the frontmatter, but it originates from the incorrect placement of the interface definition.

Plan:
1.  Wrap the script part (imports, interface definition, prop destructuring, slug calculation) inside the frontmatter (`---`).
2.  Address the incorrect usage of `rehype-slug`. Since the user wants to slugify the `name` prop, I should replace the `rehypeSlug` call with a standard slugify library or a simple custom function as discussed previously. Let's suggest installing and using the `slugify` library as it's a common and robust choice.
3.  Run `npm install slugify` (or yarn/pnpm).
4.  Modify the code to use `slugify`.

Revised Plan:
1.  Explain the error: The interface definition and prop logic need to be inside the frontmatter script (`---`).
2.  Explain the incorrect usage of `rehype-slug`.
3.  Suggest using the `slugify` library instead.
4.  Propose running `npm install slugify`.
5.  Propose editing the `src/components/Spell.astro` file to:
    *   Wrap the script logic in `---`.
    *   Replace `rehypeSlug` import and usage with `slugify`.</details></think>

Okay, let's fix this.

The error `Expected "}" but found ":"` is happening because the TypeScript code for defining the props (`interface Props { ... }`) and the logic using `Astro.props` needs to be inside the frontmatter script block (`--- ... ---`) at the top of your `.astro` file.

Additionally, the way `rehype-slug` is being used (`rehypeSlug(name)`) is incorrect. `rehype-slug` is a rehype plugin meant to be used within the Markdown processing pipeline, not as a direct function call to slugify a string.

As we discussed previously, Astro doesn't have a built-in slugify function. A good approach is to use a dedicated library like `slugify`.

First, let's install the `slugify` library. I'll propose the command to run in your terminal.
