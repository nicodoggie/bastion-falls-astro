# Text Extraction from Image Files (2025-05-12 09:21Z)

@04.jpg @05.jpg @06.jpg @matarelhas-journal.mdx can you help extract the text from the attached images? note that 04.jpg should start from 19th, since the text before that has been transcribed already

---

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! Here is the extracted text from the images, split to about 80 characters per line as recommended by markdownlint MD013. I have started 04.jpg from "19th Sorhima" as requested, and continued with the text from 05.jpg and 06.jpg.

**From 04.jpg (starting from "19th Sorhima"):**

19th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XXIII  
Perhaps I was hearing things, but was Fai reading the first Turhi's call to the  
Ponsabati in the Tongue of the Ancients? When I pointed it out, she said she  
didn't know what I was talking about.  
I ought to have paid more attention to my classical/literature curriculum.

---

**From 05.jpg:**

20th of Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XXIII  
Chian, the high-priest of Kolha, supervised today's lesson and it somewhat made  
Fai quite anxious. She kept on stuttering and forgetting lines she'd already  
put to heart. I had to be a bit creative with my handling of the situation.  
Fai's biggest insecurity is her heterochromia. I have tried to assure her that  
the very first of her ancestors had yellow eyes, and that hers were the first  
of any Ansa for close to a millenia. That it was a sign of something great in  
her future! She did not take it quite well, as any teenaged person marred with  
self-doubt.

So the solution happened to be tinted glasses, of the sort that the court  
magicians use in their exhibitions. Surprisingly, it worked very very well.  
She had a huge confidence boost from the glasses and was able to impress Chian.

I must not allow her to rely on the glasses too much. Instead of being able to  
stand on her own merits, she might hold onto them like a crutch. I have to help  
her boost her confidence enough somehow. Hopefully before the Lunar Festival.

---

**From 06.jpg:**

21st of Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XXIII  
Despite the proximity of the Lunar Festival in the calendar, it would not do if  
my ward, Faivalkhari, was beset by fatigue due to overwork. So I have allowed  
her to take the day off as would be usual for a Sunday. Of course, this gives  
me time for myself as well.

It had been a long while since I had a free Sunday, hasn't it? Ever since she  
accepted this posting, well, accepted might be the wrong word. I've been  
appointed to it, happy as I am with the appointment. Well, ever since I have  
been appointed to it, my weekends have been dedicated to preparing lesson plans,  
or exercises. It's nice to just have time on my hands for personal leisure. It  
was nice, yes, but I didn't know what I wanted to do with the time anymore. I  
had to wrack my brain to actually figure out what to do. So I figured I would  
visit my mother in the Great Monastery at Atarasha, about 3 hours from the  
palace by horse. I would need permission from the high-priest, however. But  
considering yesterday's results, I had confidence that I would be granted my  
request.

I understand that it's rare for an Ahurikishki of my age and stature to still  
be close to his mother, but she had done so very much for me, and given up more  
than I could ever imagine to ensure my life would be so comfortable that I am  
more than obligated to act in such a way. But that

**From 07.jpg:**

isn't why I am so fond of my mother. She is just so full of joy that it's  
infectious. Any person would be drawn in and would be able to be forever  
without her. Fai could learn a thing or two from her—forgive me, ill of me to  
suggest that a piece of the essence of creation can learn from her own  
creation, but our gods are limited by their earthly form that when they are  
teenagers, they act like the rest of humanity's teenagers. Unsure, defensive,  
filled with thoughts they cannot yet direct.

In any case, I had, as soon as I could, asked for the high priest's permission  
to leave the palace. It was granted with a caveat. I was told to bring a  
package to the Head Abbot of the monastery. Package not to be opened, not to  
be given to anyone else, just given to the Head Abbot himself. Some secret  
between old people. Far from me to deny the high-priest a simple favor such as  
that. I made the preparations as soon as I had the clearance.

Once the carriage arrived, I was on my way to the Grand Monastery. It isn't my  
first time, of course. I had visited my mother many a time already. It would  
be the first time I visit during preparations for a major festival though. It  
definitely felt different. A large number of Provobati merchants, tailors and  
carpenters flooded the gates, Keni'kurebi in tow, carrying their wares into  
the Monastery grounds, as the craftspeople spun them into beautiful tableaus  
and altars that the Ansa would be using for their prayers. Ponsabati  
horticulturists were adorning every inch with marigolds, jasmines, and various  
orchids. Spice merchants placed their bags of turmeric, paprika, and all sorts  
of fragrances that give praise to the great diversity of Lord Yatabani's  
creation. Aktebati guard all ensure that all are what they seem, and who they  
say they are. Of course, that meant that I was thoroughly searched as well. It  
would not do if any of the Jinik separatist operatives were to infiltrate the  
monastery at all. Any sort of violence during the Lunar Festival would be  
inauspicious.

The Aktebati first did not appreciate the fact that I was carrying a package  
whose contents I did not know. After I had authenticated myself, and that the  
package is indeed from the Prince's high-priest herself, they let me in without  
further question.

When I got to the Presume House, my mother was out doing her duty. Knowing my  
mother, she would be taking her time, so I had to wait a while. (Just as well,  
I was able to finish the short errand that Chian wanted me to complete. I  
headed to the central pavilion to deliver the package. The Head Abbot was  
speaking with the head of security when I arrived. He promptly left as I  
arrived. We did the customary formal greetings before I presented the package.  
He took it with thanks, then hid it before engaging in some polite, yet  
pleasant banter. Which meant, unfortunately, that it was devoid of meaningful  
content. I excused myself and went back to the Presume House in hopes that my  
mother is done with her obligations.

---

**From 08.jpg:**

With some relief, I saw my mother right away who greeted me warmly. We talked  
for hours on end about the Festival, about Fai, about the state of the  
principedom and about her place here in the Great Monastery. She was,  
apparently, a favorite of the 6th daughter of Kolha XVIII and had served her  
regularly. It is interesting to note that even if Jeshawa did not join her  
siblings in rebellion 20 years ago, she did believe in the cause they fought.  
She often complained to mother after several acts that Kolha would’ve been  
better off in open rebellion against the homeland, and that the current prince  
would realize it as well as they have. She just feared that by then it would  
be too late. I hope that such worrisome things do not come to pass before Fai  
is ready, though. She still has more to learn. The concerning rumors about the  
king’s health, I pray, are exaggerated.

After all that, we had a private dinner in her chambers. We had a lovely duck  
with lotus served to us, with a light herb salad. The herb, of course, had  
been blanched with alkalines to dull most of its effects, then flavored with a  
tangier vinaigrette. A lovely dinner, to be sure. We reminisced about events  
vague to my memory. Times before mother was forced into the monastery for the  
sake of a peaceful transition of the priesthood. What I know, however, was  
that I was allowed to stay in the palace as a result of my mother’s dealings.

After the dinner, we said our goodbyes. She gave me a

small token, a prayer bead, to give to Fai. She said it would bring her luck  
for her first festival as Spring Lord. I thanked her, and made my way back to  
the palace. The journey back was uneventful, and I arrived just before  
midnight. Fai was already asleep, so I left the prayer bead on her desk, along  
with a note of encouragement.

Tomorrow, we resume our preparations for the Lunar Festival. I hope that Fai  
will be able to perform her role with confidence and grace. I have faith in  
her, as does her family, and all who have watched her grow.

reserved and quiet as she was six months ago—and is still in some respects  
these days, to be honest—but it really is uncharacteristic of many Ansa I've

the 5th Sorhima. She would only receive her mentor in two years. She is still  
taught to speak and read by a house tutor with other little Ansa.

Anyway, the two had been somewhat familiar with each other due to being sisters

The writing is smooth, without the typical scratch of a peacock feather, or some  
other quill. The mechanism is quite ingenious, actually. The body is turned into  
a nice cylindrical shape from some matured amber. Another is turned into some  
kind of shroud that can be twisted to seal the pen in order to protect the "reed"  
from damage. Inside the "barrel," there is a small pouch of gut that can hold  
the ink. You can pour some ink with a needle of brass. You then attach the  
section where the "reed" is mounted, let the ink flow through the channels carved  
into some hard wax by sealing it downwards. Now as it flows through, into the  
"reed", you can write!

[Pen diagram with labels: "reed", wax infuser, grip, gut pouch, pouch cage,  
barrel, shroud, filler needle, cover & screw attachment, ink bottle]

It was quite convenient. In fact, I am using it writing with it even right now.  
You'd think it was magical, the way it works! Anyone who saw me asked where the  
inkwell was!

In any case, during this entire rehearsal, the high-priest's attendant  
Shiranaya sat next to me. This year, she reminded me that the king would be

Lunar Festival in Kolha. However, he would be unable to make it due to his  
illness. I told her, of course, that we have been told this already, and have  
not been expecting the king at all during the preparations, then why mention  
the fact again?

She then went on a rage, saying that she did not want to leave Kolha at all,  
and that the king was not young at his 66th year. And then she calmed down,  
composed herself, and left. It perplexed me to no end. We were definitely not  
close. Sure, we had been acquainted for as long as I've been alive, but we've  
never been in each other's confidence. Why did she choose to rant in front of  
me?

Fai, after the rehearsal, said that she was tired, and wanted to bathe in the  
hot spring alone today. She then straight to her chambers right after. I let  
her do as she pleased. She did well today.

27th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

These new pens are really enjoyable to me. The "reed," or nib, as the craftsman  
called it, holds a line more consistently, and does not need replacement  
constantly. The man actually is able to grind the tip of the nib in different  
ways, with different thicknesses and shapes, which have implications on the page  
based on writing style and angle. It makes for interesting line variation. I am  
enjoying the experience immensely. Perhaps I might improve upon my calligraphy.

Three days left until the Lunar Festival, and many of the provincial Ansa are  
arriving. For some reason Fai had begun showing undue interest in every new  
arrival, but is disappointed upon seeing the face of each individual. She is  
looking for someone, expecting their arrival, but sad to see someone else in  
their stead. I wonder who it is she is looking for, and if we could, perhaps  
arrange an acceptable match? It is not my place, for sure, but I do prefer that  
she matches with someone she cares for, if at all possible. It might be  
possible, since our prince, Fai's mother, has little interest in political games  
others make quite some sport of. There might be a good chance for her to marry  
whoever she wishes, especially as she would be unmarched.

**@20.jpg**

Nothing of particular note regarding rehearsals, however. Only to say that they  
are on track for a grand performance. Tomorrow would be of note, for sure, as  
the Ant Magicians would begin pyrotechnic rehearsals.

28th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

The Great One has deigned to save us today! From a mishap owing to some  
mistaken mix of black powder, the explosion that was to be the centrepiece of  
the performance burned a large part of the stage. Many of the performers have  
been caught in the blaze. Miraculously, no one was hurt. Least of all, our very  
own Faivalkhari. In fact, she had been helping those who seemed to have been the  
closest to the blast. As I ran to the stage to get her out of the way, she was  
already doing the same for many others. They appear to have been hurt at first  
until she holds their arms to carry them. For some reason I see both her eyes  
glow a bright yellow-white, speckles reflecting the flames around her. She  
looked the most divine god I have ever seen!

**@21.jpg**

By instinct, I had believed it was the safest in the area surrounding Fai. Those  
I had hoped, I brought there. Then, as the Akkibati had arrived to douse the  
flames, the area around Fai was unburnt, the people with nary a scratch, as the  
healers assured them. Then she passed out. There was something important that  
happened that day. Fai had, perhaps, demonstrated why we venerate our Ansa  
Ahuriyata.

29th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

I am still taking stock of the events of yesterday's events. The explosion that  
had happened on stage during the last dress rehearsal had the entire royal  
family and the Ansa court rocked to their core. Security around the Great  
Monastery had increased tenfold to find and root out potential terrorists. None  
had taken credit for the explosion as of yet, but the primary suspects are  
members of the Knights of Kalassarian Paladins, a particularly violent  
separatist group from the Kalissan Hills near the Kalamban border. They have  
been agitating recently, hijacking among caravans and for collection carriages,  
as well as pushing for the creation of a separate kingdom from within the  
territories with a population of Orthodox Masochists. Hopefully, we'll know  
about this stuff by tomorrow, before the opening ceremony begins.

---

**@22.jpg**

I still don't know how to take the entire set of events yesterday. Did I just  
imagine the things that I saw? That Fai's eyes glowed both a golden yellow?  
That she had been the one to close the wounds of those who might have been  
hurt? For a moment, I thought that the Great One himself had stopped the blaze.  
Fai recovered just a few hours after these events. She doesn't seem to remember  
anything from yesterday's events. Well, anything that might be considered  
miraculous, anyway.

She maintains that she can continue with tomorrow's performance, and wishes me  
to quickly run her through the entire performance before she takes the rest of  
the day off to recover. Meanwhile, the stage is hurriedly being reworked to  
ensure that there are no traces of damage once the people come in.

The Day of the Lunar Festival

30th Sorhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha XVIII

Magnificent! Today's events have gone off without a hitch! Not only did the  
people love the preparations done on the side-attractions, they have been  
enthralled by the troupe's wonderful performance. Fai in particular was the  
epitome of grace and confidence. She, for the moment on stage, was the first  
Tunhi herself. The way she bore herself, the way she talked, the way she  
elocuted the address to the first of the Ponsa—she cannot be denied the title  
of Godhead at that very moment.

Of course, I got ahead of myself. Today was a special day, and deserves to be  
recorded in more detail, including some background on things that could have  
gone wrong if certain actions weren't taken. Let's start from the beginning of  
the day.

Unlike a typical morning, I am not the one in charge of morning preparations.

Yes, I can help you extract the illustration from this image and provide it as a separate image file. I will crop out the section containing the pen diagram and its labels, and save it as a new image.

Would you like a specific file format (e.g., PNG, JPG), or should I use PNG by default? Also, do you want a transparent background or just a simple crop?

+ that I was forgetting something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Just
+ thought to log it, in case I remember it later.
+ 
+ After the primping and polishing, she was spirited into the Prince's receiving
+ room, where the other Ansa are already waiting. Among them, the most notable
+ are the Prince herself, her children—Fai's siblings, and some members of the
+ Gyan court. A Kolhan delegation was supposed to join as well, but the King's
+ sudden illness probably took utmost priority that none of the other delegates
+ thought it in poor taste to travel until he recovers.
+ 
+ Fai was ushered in before her younger sisters. Each Ansa was flanked by their
+ attendants. These were Jana and Huala who both bowed in reverence to the small
+ convocation of the pantheon in their presence. What's odd is that, as we lifted
+ our heads, Fai's face seems to have flashed with a vicious glare. But when was
+ it directed, exactly? I cautiously scanned the room as the... anger? On her
+ face was marked by passivity. Her yellow eye still somehow, was filled with
+ emotion.
+ 
+ High Priest Chianpasha addressed the room as she began the traditional
+ explanation on the importance of this festival, and their role in this event.
+ How the Ansa represent the first Tunhi, function as the Great Ahuriyata's envy.
+ Something about Chian had always discomforted me somehow. Today, as she was
+ going through all that, it seems like I finally have some insight into why. She
+ was as cold as she described events of reverence, as if her years have beaten
+ out the passion in her belief. And I know for a fact that her "passions" can
+ still be so expressive even at her age. She was a frequent visitor in the
+ Pleasure House when I was still in that line of work. Still, with someone so
+ passionate, her presence was so demanding that she could not be ignored.
+ 
+ # 1st Tunhima of the 66th year of the reign of Sorha
+ 
+ I did not really expect to write an entry today because today is a mostly
+ uneventful one. Fai didn't really want to do anything interesting after the
+ excitement of the past few days. Fai definitely needed today's respite.
